# Project Charter

* **Vision**: Help concertgoers make informed decisions regarding when to buy concert tickets, giving them time to find out if friends and family are interested in attending as well, without fear of encountering a sold-out event by the time they've finished coordinating a group outing. This will increase marginal utility for users, and allow more social-influencing activity, increasing the chances of exposing a larger set of people to artists, venues, and events.
* **Mission**: Build an app which shows a user upcoming events in their area, and gives real-time predictions on whether a particular show will sell out.
* **Success Criteria**: 
  * Machine-Learning: We want to consider both the precision and recall of our model, as the recall (ability to successfully identify sell-outs) provides value to a user directly, while the precision (ability to accurately predict only true sell-outs, not over-predict) can provide value to potential partners (increase the chances of exposure of new people to artists, venues, and events by interested users). As such, we want to evaluate our machine learning model through the F1 score, which combines both precision and recall metrics. If we were able to get a 70% for both precision and recall, that would yield an F1 score of .7, so we would seek to meet or exceed this threshold.
  * Business Outcome: If we were successful in providing value to users on giving predictions for upcoming events, we would expect to see users more consistently buy tickets and more often buy more than one ticket (given that they had time to coordinate with others instead of worrying about being able to get a ticket before it sold-out). In order to be successful, we would want this increase in mean tickets sold within a given period for users of the app to be 5% or higher.
