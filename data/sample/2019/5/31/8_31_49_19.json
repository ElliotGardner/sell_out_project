After 12 years of playing as many as 300 shows each year, Rev. Peyton, the world\u2019s foremost country blues finger-style picker, along with the biggest little band in the country has pieced together one of the most dedicated followings out there. This following is sure to eat up the band\u2019s latest offering, Poor Until Payday, (the second on their own Family Owned Records label through hip Nashville indie Thirty Tigers) out October 5th, a country blues record that was made the right way \u2014 two feet on the ground and both hands getting dirty.\nWith all the power of a freight train, the Big Damn Band is known for its live shows. Rev. Peyton delivers guitar pyrotechnics the old fashioned way \u2014 ten fingers, a 6 string and an amp cranked at full tilt. In the country blues style, he plays the bass with his thumb, while picking the lead with his fingers at the same time. When he lifts the guitar behind his head to play there\u2019s nothing but skill and 16 gauge nickel strings to make the sounds coming out of the speakers.\nBeside him on stage are just two other people. His wife, \u201cWashboard\u201d Breezy Peyton playing with all the nuance and percussive power of a New Orleans drum line, and keeping the train moving is Max Senteney on a lean drum kit including a 5 gallon maple syrup bucket. Together they play Peyton\u2019s wildman country blues that\u2019s as much ZZ Top as it is Bukka White.\nOn Poor Until Payday Peyton wanted a sound as live and electric as the records made in the heyday of 45 rpm blues classics from Chess, Stax and Sun Records. Playing his beloved custom-made National steel resonator, a 1949 Harmony Archtop, a 1954 Supro Dual Tone and a 1955 Kay Speed Demon through a 1949 Supro amp, Rev wanted to restore the \u201cwarmth, pops and hisses\u201d mostly eliminated by modern-day compression. The band played in a room together with minimal micing (using only the best classic pieces they could get) with the main effect being tape saturation.\nThat\u2019s it.\nThe result is an album that is direct, soulful and demands to be played loud.\nThe themes of songs like the title track, \u201cYou Can\u2019t Steal My Shine\u201d and \u201cI Suffer I Get Tougher\u201d offer the antidote to today\u2019s hard times by touting \u201cperseverance, inspiration and hope\u2026 being your authentic self despite everything lined against you, a light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d With a vocal style reflecting both the soulfulness and bite of his idols, Rev has added world-class singer to his already-renowned skills as a finger-pickin\u2019 guitar phenom. Breezy and Max also contribute background vocals to most of the songs, with \u201cThe Miss Elizabeth of Country Blues\u201d actually taking the spotlight with a sultry call-and-response showcase on \u201cDirty Swerve,\u201d in which she also contributed to the writing.\nPeyton\u2019s blues pedigree is well established. Woodshedding since he was 12, Peyton has kept alive a tradition of finger picking pioneered by the likes of Mississippi John Hurt. However, Peyton plays with the energy and attitude of a Howlin\u2019 Wolf. Indeed if it has strings he can play it whether that\u2019s a custom-built National, a cigarbox, an axe or even a shotgun (seriously, Google it.).\nHe\u2019s done his homework and been given the blessing of the gatekeepers of the tradition \u2014 even befriending and touring with some of the last of the great Delta Blues and Hill Country blues legends like David \u201cHoneyboy\u201d Edwards, T-Model Ford (whose grandson calls him Unk), and Robert Belfour.\nRev and Breezy make their home in rural southern Indiana near the adopted home of bluegrass legend Bill Monroe, among national parks and forests in what began as an artist\u2019s colony. \u201cMost of the people here can both paint a picture and skin a deer,\u201d laughs Breezy.\nThere\u2019s nothing dusty or sentimental about Peyton\u2019s music, though. There\u2019s no songs about picking cotton. They aren\u2019t a museum piece. The Big Damn Band have taken nearly a century of blues songsmanship and crafted a thing all their own. There is not a single act out there that sounds like this.\nThe Big Damn Band make friends and fans every place they go \u2014 and there are few places they haven\u2019t been, having performed in 37 countries. After Poor Until Payday, the only people who won\u2019t be on the big damn bandwagon will be people who haven\u2019t heard or aren\u2019t paying attention.\nThis is real, from the heart, handmade music made by people, for people who don\u2019t have time for BS.\nWebsite\n\nFAQs\nPlease click here for a detailed FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

The band's energy and intensity is well exemplified by the heretofore unreleased, vintage tracks contained on POWERFUL STUFF!, its latest recording for Landslide Records. A potent mixture of roots rock, Americana, blues, and British influences, the album primarily features the \"original\" Beatnecks: Wilder on lead vocals and guitar, Donny \"The Twangler\" Roberts, guitar and vocals, Denny \"Cletus\" Blakely, bass and vocals, and Jimmy Lester, drums, who were one of the most popular touring bands from the mid-1980s into the 1990s. POWERFUL STUFF! presents timeless live and studio tracks, many of which were produced by R.S. \"Bobby\" Field, a founding member of The Beatnecks, split equally between original songs and distinctive cover renditions, all of which inexplicably escaped release back in the day.\n\"As our song 'Lost In The Shuffle' suggests, that's kind of what happened to these tapes,\" said Wilder, who is excited to finally see them available to his \"loving public.\" \"All the tunes from this new, old stock were performed throughout those early years, and consequently the band was tight and in top form when we recorded. Our sound came out of a variety of influential genres, and all of them are represented here.\" Compiled and remixed (where possible) by Wilder and George \"the Tone Chaperone\" Bradfute at his Tone Chapparral studio in Madison, TN, the new album was culled from dozens of recordings that had been carefully stored in a Nashville facility for over 30 years.\nThe title track, \"Powerful Stuff,\" written by Field, was a Beatnecks' original that unfortunately stayed in the can after The Fabulous Thunderbirds picked it up and made it one of their biggest hits that landed a spot on the soundtrack of the 1988 motion picture, COCKTAIL, a box office winner. \"Make That Move,\" a long forgotten blast from Britain's Levi and the Rockats, kicks off the album in breakneck fashion, followed by \"New Day,\" a somewhat timely composition by Webb and Terry Anderson (Woods, Yayhoos). POWERFUL STUFF! moves along at a crisp pace showing the band's ability to shift effortlessly from disparate material such as Sam and Dave's \"Ain't That A Lot Of Love\" (accompanied by a full blown horn section), Lightnin' Hopkins' \"I'm Wild About You Baby,\" Steve Forbert's \"Catbird Seat,\" a spirited take of Johnny Paycheck's \"Revenooer Man\" and even a raucous cover of Little Richard's \"Lucille,\" that echoes Jerry Lee Lewis at his finest.\nA native of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, Wilder moved to Austin, Texas in 1976 with his friend since junior high, Bobby Field, who would later co- found the Beatnecks with him as well as write many memorable songs and produce several earlier records. After moving to Nashville, Wilder and Field formed the Beatnecks in 1985. As Nashville moved toward unapologetically commercial fare, Wilder and Field were busy crafting their signature brand of rock 'n' roll, founded on classic influences from both sides of the pond. The band's debut, IT CAME FROM NASHVILLE, a brazenly rocking bar-band rave-up (also available from Landslide) was recently named by PASTE Magazine as one of the 50 Best Southern Rock Albums of All Time. Wilder's subsequent releases, HYBRID VIGOR, DOO DAD, TOWN & COUNTRY, ACRES OF SUEDE, ABOUT TIME, BORN TO BE WILDER (live) and MORE LIKE ME, have continually maintained the high standard set initially, becoming textbooks for aspiring roots rockers and showing there was (and is) a vibrant market for their hybrid brand of rootsy musical gumbo. In its review of Wilder's most recent release, MISSISSIPPI MODERNE, GUITAR PLAYER Magazine called Webb \"a national treasure.\"\nMusic critics have always warmed up to the Webb Wilder juggernaut. The Associated Press described the band's music and stage performance as \"a glorious amalgamation of grunge chords, killer grooves, Screamin' Jay Hawkins theatrics, a healthy sense of humor, and great pop melodies.\" It's \"full of wit and personality, and devoid of technological or conceptual gimmickry,\" added the Houston Post.\nThe same formula powers\u00a0POWERFUL STUFF!, an exciting blend of bedrock American music incorporating a host of styles.

The band's energy and intensity is well exemplified by the heretofore unreleased, vintage tracks contained on POWERFUL STUFF!, its latest recording for Landslide Records. A potent mixture of roots rock, Americana, blues, and British influences, the album primarily features the \"original\" Beatnecks: Wilder on lead vocals and guitar, Donny \"The Twangler\" Roberts, guitar and vocals, Denny \"Cletus\" Blakely, bass and vocals, and Jimmy Lester, drums, who were one of the most popular touring bands from the mid-1980s into the 1990s. POWERFUL STUFF! presents timeless live and studio tracks, many of which were produced by R.S. \"Bobby\" Field, a founding member of The Beatnecks, split equally between original songs and distinctive cover renditions, all of which inexplicably escaped release back in the day.</P>\n<P>\"As our song 'Lost In The Shuffle' suggests, that's kind of what happened to these tapes,\" said Wilder, who is excited to finally see them available to his \"loving public.\" \"All the tunes from this new, old stock were performed throughout those early years, and consequently the band was tight and in top form when we recorded. Our sound came out of a variety of influential genres, and all of them are represented here.\" Compiled and remixed (where possible) by Wilder and George \"the Tone Chaperone\" Bradfute at his Tone Chapparral studio in Madison, TN, the new album was culled from dozens of recordings that had been carefully stored in a Nashville facility for over 30 years.</P>\n<P>The title track, \"Powerful Stuff,\" written by Field, was a Beatnecks' original that unfortunately stayed in the can after The Fabulous Thunderbirds picked it up and made it one of their biggest hits that landed a spot on the soundtrack of the 1988 motion picture, COCKTAIL, a box office winner. \"Make That Move,\" a long forgotten blast from Britain's Levi and the Rockats, kicks off the album in breakneck fashion, followed by \"New Day,\" a somewhat timely composition by Webb and Terry Anderson (Woods, Yayhoos). POWERFUL STUFF! moves along at a crisp pace showing the band's ability to shift effortlessly from disparate material such as Sam and Dave's \"Ain't That A Lot Of Love\" (accompanied by a full blown horn section), Lightnin' Hopkins' \"I'm Wild About You Baby,\" Steve Forbert's \"Catbird Seat,\" a spirited take of Johnny Paycheck's \"Revenooer Man\" and even a raucous cover of Little Richard's \"Lucille,\" that echoes Jerry Lee Lewis at his finest.</P>\n<P>A native of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, Wilder moved to Austin, Texas in 1976 with his friend since junior high, Bobby Field, who would later co- found the Beatnecks with him as well as write many memorable songs and produce several earlier records. After moving to Nashville, Wilder and Field formed the Beatnecks in 1985. As Nashville moved toward unapologetically commercial fare, Wilder and Field were busy crafting their signature brand of rock 'n' roll, founded on classic influences from both sides of the pond. The band's debut, IT CAME FROM NASHVILLE, a brazenly rocking bar-band rave-up (also available from Landslide) was recently named by PASTE Magazine as one of the 50 Best Southern Rock Albums of All Time. Wilder's subsequent releases, HYBRID VIGOR, DOO DAD, TOWN &amp; COUNTRY, ACRES OF SUEDE, ABOUT TIME, BORN TO BE WILDER (live) and MORE LIKE ME, have continually maintained the high standard set initially, becoming textbooks for aspiring roots rockers and showing there was (and is) a vibrant market for their hybrid brand of rootsy musical gumbo. In its review of Wilder's most recent release, MISSISSIPPI MODERNE, GUITAR PLAYER Magazine called Webb \"a national treasure.\"</P>\n<P>Music critics have always warmed up to the Webb Wilder juggernaut. The Associated Press described the band's music and stage performance as \"a glorious amalgamation of grunge chords, killer grooves, Screamin' Jay Hawkins theatrics, a healthy sense of humor, and great pop melodies.\" It's \"full of wit and personality, and devoid of technological or conceptual gimmickry,\" added the Houston Post.</P>\n<P>The same formula powers\u00a0<I>POWERFUL STUFF!</I>, an exciting blend of bedrock American music incorporating a host of styles.

The animated video for their song \"Waiting\" sparked viral interest including Buzzfeed, Pitchfork, and inclusion at the international TED 2015 conference. Mountain Stage host Larry Groce calls them \"ready to take their place among the best young male/female duos now performing.\" Their 2016 release, the six-song EP In the Altogether, earned features by Apple Music including \"Best of the Week\" and \"A-List Singer/Songwriter.\" Recently, Paste Music / Daytrotter described the band as \"defined by their infallible vocal harmonies and their unconventional song arrangements. The Sea The Sea is a pop band only in their melodic infectiousness\u2014otherwise they are at their best when subverting conventions.\"\nFREDDY & FRANCINEAuthenticity in the music industry is slippery when wet. Everyone praises its value, yet when an artist is truly authentic, it is often only embraced if it can be easily walked on without slipping and landing in a pile of genre-related questions.\nTo the casual observer, Freddy & Francine seem safely cemented as a folk duo. They got the look. The soulful harmonies. The folk circuit bookings \u2014 over 150 a year, including the legendary Telluride Bluegrass Festival. They\u2019re even getting married. Cute. Even their act\u2019s name is cute. You could make a movie about it. Someone probably has.\nBut Freddy & Francine (their actual names are Lee Ferris and Bianca Caruso) aren\u2019t interested in acting, or genres, or talking or not talking about their relationship. They\u2019ve done all that. They\u2019ve even recently left their longtime home of Los Angeles for Nashville. And they\u2019ve never looked more like themselves.\n\u201cWe just want to play music all the time and we don't care about the rest of the bullshit,\u201d Ferris said.\nAnd there\u2019s been plenty of bullshit. The Hollywood types, the rat race, the traffic, Ferris\u2019s struggle with alcoholism (he\u2019s now five years sober). Longtime fans know that the band took a three-year hiatus when Ferris and Caruso\u2019s relationship unraveled, a time which found Ferris turning his back on music while driving trucks in L.A., and Caruso working an office job in New York.\nDuring this break, both seemingly were able to land on their feet. Ferris was cast as Carl Perkins in the Broadway and touring productions of Million Dollar Quartet, and Caruso co-wrote and filmed a television pilot in Joni Mitchell\u2019s Laurel Canyon home (her friend rents it), featuring Seth Rogen, and sold the thing to ABC.\nBut appearances can be deceiving. \u201cI was miserable in the whole process, because I wasn't connected to myself in my gut,\u201d Caruso said. \u201cI didn\u2019t enjoy it. I enjoy traveling and playing music.\u201d\nDespite rockin\u2019 in Perkins\u2019 blue suede shoes from Memphis to Japan, in front of thousands of people, Ferris was also unhappy because he was singing someone else\u2019s songs.\n\u201cMy heroes were Joni Mitchell, The Stones, Dylan, B.B. King, Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins, Carl Perkins, the guys who just tapped into something in themselves, who needed to write and speak their own truth. That\u2019s who I am,\u201d Ferris said.\nAdding, \u201cThe experience of sitting down with an instrument and coming up with something for the first time, you can\u2019t beat that. The best experience I\u2019ve ever had as a person doing that, and coming up with something that is bigger than the sum of its parts, is with Bianca.\u201d\nBut this is all old news. Freddy & Francine are full-time musicians, and have released three full-length albums and two EPs \u2014 not to mention Ferris\u2019s production of an album by award-winning actor William H. Macy (featuring Caruso\u2019s vocals), and the duo\u2019s collaboration with Dead & Co. keyboardist Jeff Chimenti on the musical direction and casting for 2017\u2019s Off-Broadway musical \u201cRed Roses, Green Gold,\u201d featuring the music of The Grateful Dead.\nKeeping truckin\u2019, Freddy & Francine plan to release their latest Nashville-recorded EP in September. The six-song \u201cMoonless Night,\u201d co-produced by Dan Knobler (Lake Street Dive, Rodney Crowell) finds Freddy & Francine \u2014 which has often used full bands on its recordings \u2014 still produced but more intimately portrayed, a sound closer to the duo\u2019s live performances.\nBut don\u2019t call it folk music. It\u2019s too energetic.\n\u201cWe\u2019re performers. We\u2019re not just folk musicians who play and sing mellow songs with little voices ... there\u2019s screaming,\u201d Caruso said. Don\u2019t call it Americana either. They don\u2019t wear hats. Besides, Caruso says, \u201cThe minute you think one of our songs is an Americana song, it can turn into a retro pop song.\u201d\nDespite the reaction of most roots music fans to the dreaded \u201cP\u201d word, Caruso says she doesn\u2019t mind Freddy & Francine being labeled a pop band.\n\u201cPop music gets a bad rap, but it comes from the word \u2018popular.\u2019 I\u2019d love to be popular,\u201d she said. \u201cI never discriminate against a song because it\u2019s popular if it stays in your head ... every Beatles song is a pop song.\u201d\nBut mostly, Freddy & Francine sounds like Freddy & Francine. It ain\u2019t the easiest thing to explain, but it makes sense when you hear it, and finally, it makes sense to the two people who matter most.\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy with who I am and I'm happy with the life I have,\u201d Ferris said.

They aren't revivalists; they're modern men, carrying the torch of melodic, riff-ready,\u00a0high-energy rock into new territory.\nWhittled into sharp shape by a touring schedule that's kept them busy for roughly 175 days a year \u2014 including two European tours, countless stateside runs, and appearances at festivals like Bonnaroo \u2014 Wild Adriatic's three members recorded Feel in Austin, teaming up with Grammy-nominated producer Frenchie Smith in the process. The goal was to shine a light on the band's strength as a live act, avoiding click tracks, digital instruments, sampled sounds, and other tricks of the recording studio. Instead, Wild Adriatic focused on the same core ingredients \u2014 Gray's guitar playing and soulful sweep of a voice; Vosganian's percussive stomp; Derbyshire'sin-the-pocket bass \u2014 that helped kickstart the band in 2011, back when Wild\nAdriatic formed in Upstate New York.\fFrom the psychedelic \"Chasing a Ghost\" to the mellow, horn-filled \"Come Baby Baby\" \u2014 the latter song featuring blasts of brass from the West End Horns \u2014 Feel offers up 11 new songs of modern, analog, groove-heavy rock, with Wild Adriatic taking inspiration from breakups, friendships, new relationships, tour stops, and even politics. \"Appleton\" finds the guys paying tribute to the Wisconsin town that's hosted some of their most memorable shows, while songs like \"Some Nerve\" and \"Hurricane Woman\" channel the influence of guitar greats like Stevie Ray Vaughan and JoeWalsh. Much of the album came together during five separate writing retreats, including treks to Virginia, Texas and Wisconsin. Throughout it all, the songs were written collaboratively, molded by a band of longtime friends who, more than a half-decade into their career, are still turning over new leaves.\n\"This feels like our first record all over again,\" says Vosganian, a childhood friend of Gray since his elementary-school days. \"We're a rock and roll band\u00a0at heart, but we have heavy ties to soul and blues music, too, and as the band matures, those roots come out. This is a great way to reintroduce ourselves.\"\nGray agrees, saying that the real-life inspiration behind most of the album \u2014 a painful breakup \u2014 helped Wild Adriatic create a record that ultimately celebrates the electricity and elation of playing in a traveling band.\f\"These songs align with everything we've gone through in the last year,\" he adds. \"They highlight hard times, but also underlying hope and optimism. We're people. We're supported by fans who buy tickets and come out to shows, and we like to hang out with them. We aren't trying to take ourselves too seriously. We're trying to connect. We're trying to feel.\"\nWebsite\u00a0\n\nSarah Potenza\n\"I work for me,\" Sarah Potenza declares at the beginning of Road to Rome, kicking off her second solo album \u2014 a record of self-empowered R&B, swaggering soul, and contemporary blues \u2014 with her own declaration of independence.\nFilled with messages of self-worth, determination, and drive, Road to Rome shines new light on a songwriter whose career already includes multiple albums as front-woman of Sarah and the Tall Boys, a game-changing appearance on The Voice, and an acclaimed solo debut titled Monster. Released one year after she sang in front of 12 million people during The Voice's eighth season, 2016's Monster prompted Rolling Stone to gush, \"Potenza is to the blues what Adele is to pop: a colossal-voiced singer who merges her old-school influences with a modernistic sound.\" Three years later, that sound deepens and intensifies with Road to Rome, an album that shows the full scope of Potenza's aims and ambitions.\nAnd just who is Sarah Potenza? She's a songwriter. A bold, brassy singer. A businesswoman. A proud, loud-mouthed Italian-American from Providence, Rhode Island, with roots in Nashville and an audience that stretches across the Atlantic. Road to Rome spells it all out. Co-written by Potenza, produced by Jordan Brooke Hamlin (Indigo Girls, Lucy Wainwright Roche), and recorded with a female-heavy cast of collaborators, the album isn't just her own story. It's the story of all artists \u2014 particularly women, who remain the minority within the male-dominated music industry \u2014 who've learned to trust their instincts, refusing to let mainstream trends dilute their own artistic statements.\nFor Potenza, such lessons were learned during the writing sessions for Road to Rome, which took place aboard a cruise ship in the Caribbean, as well as at her home in East Nashville. It was during the cruise that she first began writing songs with Justin Wiseman, a piano player from Austin, TX. For years, she and her husband, Ian Crossman, had worked together as a duo, splitting their musical duties more or less equally, writing songs with guitar in hand, and merging their very different influences. This was something different, though \u2014 something about the piano that allowed Potenza the chance to rediscover her own voice, making an album whose unique approach to soul music was entirely her own. Although Crossman and Wiseman\u2019s contributions as co-writers can be heard throughout Road to Rome's tracks, the album represents a strong shift in dynamic, with Potenza leading the charge.\nWhen it came time to record Road to Rome at MOXE, Jordan Brooke Hamlin's Nashville-area studio, Potenza looked to a wide range of musicians for influence. She turned to Whitney Houston. To Lauryn Hill. To Pops Staples, the Dirty Projectors, RL Burnside, Bette Midler, and more. Those artists gave her inspiration not only on a musical level, but on an emotional and thematic level, too. They were artists who spoke with conviction, chasing their own muses into unique, personalized territory. Potenza did the same, turning Road to Rome into an album filled with everything from the torch song balladry of \"Earthquake\" (a love letter to Crossman, thanking him for years of support ) to the funky fire of \"Dickerson and Queen\" (where Potenza howls, swoons, and croons over bass grooves and swirling organ, reminding everyone that, \"I don't give a fuck about nothing but the music\"). She even makes room for a piano-propelled cover of \"Worthy,\" originally written by Grammy-nominated icon Mary Gauthier, who personally sent the song to Potenza.\nReleased on International Women's Day 2019, Road to Rome is the sound of a songwriter taking the wheel and driving toward her own destination. This is Sarah Potenza's strongest album to date: a battlecry from a soul singer and blues belter, shot through with pop melodies, rock & roll attitude, and absolutely zero fucks.\nWebsite\n\n\nFAQs\nPlease click here for a detailed FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

The goal was to shine a light on the band's strength as a live act, avoiding click tracks, digital instruments, sampled sounds, and other tricks of the recording studio. Instead, Wild Adriatic focused on the same core ingredients \u2014 Gray's guitar playing and soulful sweep of a voice; Vosganian's percussive stomp; Derbyshire's<BR>in-the-pocket bass \u2014 that helped kickstart the band in 2011, back when Wild</P>\n<P>Adriatic formed in Upstate New York.\fFrom the psychedelic \"Chasing a Ghost\" to the mellow, horn-filled \"Come Baby Baby\" \u2014 the latter song featuring blasts of brass from the West End Horns \u2014 Feel offers up 11 new songs of modern, analog, groove-heavy rock, with Wild Adriatic taking inspiration from breakups, friendships, new relationships, tour stops, and even politics. \"Appleton\" finds the guys paying tribute to the Wisconsin town that's hosted some of their most memorable shows, while songs like \"Some Nerve\" and \"Hurricane Woman\" channel the influence of guitar greats like Stevie Ray Vaughan and Joe<BR>Walsh. Much of the album came together during five separate writing retreats, including treks to Virginia, Texas and Wisconsin. Throughout it all, the songs were written collaboratively, molded by a band of longtime friends who, more than a half-decade into their career, are still turning over new leaves.</P>\n<P>\"This feels like our first record all over again,\" says Vosganian, a childhood friend of Gray since his elementary-school days. \"We're a rock and roll band\u00a0at heart, but we have heavy ties to soul and blues music, too, and as the band matures, those roots come out. This is a great way to reintroduce ourselves.\"</P>\n<P>Gray agrees, saying that the real-life inspiration behind most of the album \u2014 a painful breakup \u2014 helped Wild Adriatic create a record that ultimately celebrates the electricity and elation of playing in a traveling band.\f\"These songs align with everything we've gone through in the last year,\" he adds. \"They highlight hard times, but also underlying hope and optimism. We're people. We're supported by fans who buy tickets and come out to shows, and we like to hang out with them. We aren't trying to take ourselves too seriously. We're trying to connect. We're trying to feel.\"</P>\n<P><A HREF=\"https://www.wildadriatic.com/#home-section\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Website</A>\u00a0</P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P><STRONG>Sarah Potenza</STRONG></P>\n<P>\"I work for me,\" Sarah Potenza declares at the beginning of Road to Rome, kicking off her second solo album \u2014 a record of self-empowered R&B, swaggering soul, and contemporary blues \u2014 with her own declaration of independence.</P>\n<P>Filled with messages of self-worth, determination, and drive, Road to Rome shines new light on a songwriter whose career already includes multiple albums as front-woman of Sarah and the Tall Boys, a game-changing appearance on The Voice, and an acclaimed solo debut titled Monster. Released one year after she sang in front of 12 million people during The Voice's eighth season, 2016's Monster prompted Rolling Stone to gush, \"Potenza is to the blues what Adele is to pop: a colossal-voiced singer who merges her old-school influences with a modernistic sound.\" Three years later, that sound deepens and intensifies with Road to Rome, an album that shows the full scope of Potenza's aims and ambitions.</P>\n<P>And just who is Sarah Potenza? She's a songwriter. A bold, brassy singer. A businesswoman. A proud, loud-mouthed Italian-American from Providence, Rhode Island, with roots in Nashville and an audience that stretches across the Atlantic. Road to Rome spells it all out. Co-written by Potenza, produced by Jordan Brooke Hamlin (Indigo Girls, Lucy Wainwright Roche), and recorded with a female-heavy cast of collaborators, the album isn't just her own story. It's the story of all artists \u2014 particularly women, who remain the minority within the male-dominated music industry \u2014 who've learned to trust their instincts, refusing to let mainstream trends dilute their own artistic statements.</P>\n<P>For Potenza, such lessons were learned during the writing sessions for Road to Rome, which took place aboard a cruise ship in the Caribbean, as well as at her home in East Nashville. It was during the cruise that she first began writing songs with Justin Wiseman, a piano player from Austin, TX. For years, she and her husband, Ian Crossman, had worked together as a duo, splitting their musical duties more or less equally, writing songs with guitar in hand, and merging their very different influences. This was something different, though \u2014 something about the piano that allowed Potenza the chance to rediscover her own voice, making an album whose unique approach to soul music was entirely her own. Although Crossman and Wiseman\u2019s contributions as co-writers can be heard throughout Road to Rome's tracks, the album represents a strong shift in dynamic, with Potenza leading the charge.</P>\n<P>When it came time to record Road to Rome at MOXE, Jordan Brooke Hamlin's Nashville-area studio, Potenza looked to a wide range of musicians for influence. She turned to Whitney Houston. To Lauryn Hill. To Pops Staples, the Dirty Projectors, RL Burnside, Bette Midler, and more. Those artists gave her inspiration not only on a musical level, but on an emotional and thematic level, too. They were artists who spoke with conviction, chasing their own muses into unique, personalized territory. Potenza did the same, turning Road to Rome into an album filled with everything from the torch song balladry of \"Earthquake\" (a love letter to Crossman, thanking him for years of support ) to the funky fire of \"Dickerson and Queen\" (where Potenza howls, swoons, and croons over bass grooves and swirling organ, reminding everyone that, \"I don't give a fuck about nothing but the music\"). She even makes room for a piano-propelled cover of \"Worthy,\" originally written by Grammy-nominated icon Mary Gauthier, who personally sent the song to Potenza.</P>\n<P>Released on International Women's Day 2019, Road to Rome is the sound of a songwriter taking the wheel and driving toward her own destination. This is Sarah Potenza's strongest album to date: a battlecry from a soul singer and blues belter, shot through with pop melodies, rock &amp; roll attitude, and absolutely zero fucks.</P>\n<P><A HREF=\"https://sarahpotenza.net/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Website</A></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<H2><STRONG>FAQs</STRONG></H2>\n<P><STRONG>Please click <A HREF=\"http://evanstonspace.com/faq\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</A> for a detailed FAQ.</STRONG></P>\n<P><STRONG>Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0</STRONG>Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

The Austin-based honky-tonker carries on in the tradition of Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson with his \u201cAmeripolitan\u201d brand of American roots music.\nAlbum highlights include \u201cJonesin\u2019 For Jones,\u201d a love song to the music of the legendary George Jones, \u201cA Day At A Time,\u201d about \u201cgetting by by barely getting by;\u201d \u201cCall Me Insane,\u201d the album\u2019s moody title track; \u201cBug Ya For Love,\u201d a fun warning to all the single ladies, and \u201cMamas Don\u2019t Let Your Cowboys Grow Up To Be Babies.\u201d (Yes, it is an answer song to the Waylon Jennings/Willie Nelson hit.) \u201cCrocodile Tears\u201d is a tear-in-your-beer country song that sounds like an instant classic and \u201cBurden Of The Cross\u201d reveals Watson\u2019s serious side.\nCall Me Insane was recorded in Austin by Watson and his ace touring band, \u201cHis Lone Stars\u201d: Don Pawlak (pedal steel), Mike Bernal (drums & percussion), and Chris Crepps (upright bass & background vocals). Dale plays electric guitar throughout and Lloyd Maines added acoustic guitar. They were joined in the studio by Danny Levin on piano and the Honky Tonk Horns: Jon Blondell (trombone), Joey Colarusso (saxophone), and Ricky White (trumpet).\n\u201cHaving known Lloyd over 20 years and worked with him as a musician, I knew he was a great guy and picker,\" Watson says. \"But having Lloyd produce your record is like letting your mom in your kitchen. You know you\u2019re gonna like what comes out and it's amazing how such basic ingredients can be made even better. He is an artists' artist.\nThe admiration is mutual. \"I've been a Dale Watson fan since I played steel guitar on some of his early records,\" Maines says of the sessions. \"My early musical influences are the same as Dale's. We both grew up playing real country music. Dale is one of a very short list of today's artists who still keeps it real country. I'm honored that he asked me to produce his new record. I think he knew that I would maintain the integrity of his passion for the music.\"\nDubbed \"the silver pompadoured, baritone beltin', Lone Star beer drinkin', honky-tonk hellraiser\" by The Austin Chronicle, Watson sat in with Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s house band as a guest on Jimmy Kimmel Live (ABC) from SXSW 2015. He also emceed the first ever SXSW \u201cAmeripolitan\u201d showcase featuring the best of Honky-tonk, Outlaw Country, Rockabilly and Texas Swing music.\nSince the release of El Rancho Azul in 2013, Watson\u2019s profile has risen considerably via appearances on The Late Show with David Letterman (CBS), Austin City Limits and The Sun Sessions(PBS) and as a guest on NPR\u2019s Wait Wait... Don\u2019t Tell Me. A veteran touring artist and consummate entertainer, he is on the road more than 300 days a year. He also put his money where his heart is and took over ownership of two struggling Texas honky-tonks, the Little Longhorn Saloon in Austin (home of Chicken $#!+ Bingo) and The Big T Roadhouse in St. Hedwigs (outside San Antonio). If not on the road, he and His Lone Stars perform at one of them each Sunday.\nDale has flown the flag for classic honky-tonk for over two decades. He\u2019s christened his brand of American roots \u201cAmeripolitan\u201d to differentiate it from current crop of Nashville-based pop country. The Alabama-born, Texas-raised Watson may be the hardest working entertainer today and is rapidly approaching legendary status. He is a country music maverick, a true outlaw who stands alongside Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and George Strait as one of the finest country singers and songwriters from the Lone Star State.\nWebsite\n\n\nFAQs\nPLEASE CLICK HERE FOR A DETAILED FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

The Austin-based honky-tonker carries on in the tradition of Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson with his \u201cAmeripolitan\u201d brand of American roots music.</P>\n<P>Album highlights include \u201cJonesin\u2019 For Jones,\u201d a love song to the music of the legendary George Jones, \u201cA Day At A Time,\u201d about \u201cgetting by by barely getting by;\u201d \u201cCall Me Insane,\u201d the album\u2019s moody title track; \u201cBug Ya For Love,\u201d a fun warning to all the single ladies, and \u201cMamas Don\u2019t Let Your Cowboys Grow Up To Be Babies.\u201d (Yes, it is an answer song to the Waylon Jennings/Willie Nelson hit.) \u201cCrocodile Tears\u201d is a tear-in-your-beer country song that sounds like an instant classic and \u201cBurden Of The Cross\u201d reveals Watson\u2019s serious side.</P>\n<P>Call Me Insane was recorded in Austin by Watson and his ace touring band, \u201cHis Lone Stars\u201d: Don Pawlak (pedal steel), Mike Bernal (drums &amp; percussion), and Chris Crepps (upright bass &amp; background vocals). Dale plays electric guitar throughout and Lloyd Maines added acoustic guitar. They were joined in the studio by Danny Levin on piano and the Honky Tonk Horns: Jon Blondell (trombone), Joey Colarusso (saxophone), and Ricky White (trumpet).</P>\n<P>\u201cHaving known Lloyd over 20 years and worked with him as a musician, I knew he was a great guy and picker,\" Watson says. \"But having Lloyd produce your record is like letting your mom in your kitchen. You know you\u2019re gonna like what comes out and it's amazing how such basic ingredients can be made even better. He is an artists' artist.</P>\n<P>The admiration is mutual. \"I've been a Dale Watson fan since I played steel guitar on some of his early records,\" Maines says of the sessions. \"My early musical influences are the same as Dale's. We both grew up playing real country music. Dale is one of a very short list of today's artists who still keeps it real country. I'm honored that he asked me to produce his new record. I think he knew that I would maintain the integrity of his passion for the music.\"</P>\n<P>Dubbed \"the silver pompadoured, baritone beltin', Lone Star beer drinkin', honky-tonk hellraiser\" by The Austin Chronicle, Watson sat in with Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s house band as a guest on Jimmy Kimmel Live (ABC) from SXSW 2015. He also emceed the first ever SXSW \u201cAmeripolitan\u201d showcase featuring the best of Honky-tonk, Outlaw Country, Rockabilly and Texas Swing music.</P>\n<P>Since the release of El Rancho Azul in 2013, Watson\u2019s profile has risen considerably via appearances on The Late Show with David Letterman (CBS), Austin City Limits and The Sun Sessions(PBS) and as a guest on NPR\u2019s Wait Wait... Don\u2019t Tell Me. A veteran touring artist and consummate entertainer, he is on the road more than 300 days a year. He also put his money where his heart is and took over ownership of two struggling Texas honky-tonks, the Little Longhorn Saloon in Austin (home of Chicken $#!+ Bingo) and The Big T Roadhouse in St. Hedwigs (outside San Antonio). If not on the road, he and His Lone Stars perform at one of them each Sunday.</P>\n<P>Dale has flown the flag for classic honky-tonk for over two decades. He\u2019s christened his brand of American roots \u201cAmeripolitan\u201d to differentiate it from current crop of Nashville-based pop country. The Alabama-born, Texas-raised Watson may be the hardest working entertainer today and is rapidly approaching legendary status. He is a country music maverick, a true outlaw who stands alongside Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and George Strait as one of the finest country singers and songwriters from the Lone Star State.</P>\n<P><A HREF=\"https://www.dalewatson.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Website</A></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<H2><STRONG>FAQs</STRONG></H2>\n<P><EM><STRONG>PLEASE CLICK <A HREF=\"http://evanstonspace.com/faq\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">HERE</A> FOR A DETAILED FAQ.</STRONG></EM></P>\n<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0</STRONG>Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

Displaying his virtuosity on electric as well as acoustic guitar, Robinson was voted \u201cBest New Talent\u201d in the Guitar Player Readers\u2019 Poll and landed a coveted spot as one of Australian Guitar Magazine\u2019s Top 50 Best Guitarists!\nCheck out his amazing fingerstyle here:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zXwp9xH8SU\nRobinson\u2019s talents were further recognized by Guitar Player magazine as part of a cover story entitled \u201cYouthquake 2017: Ten Mind-Blowing Young Guitarists.\u201d In the article, Guitar Player observes Robinson is \u201cequally mind-blowing as an acoustic fingerpicker and electric soloist\u2026his YouTube videos display an astounding combination of taste, speed, cagey phrasing, and a clear, articulate, and sparking tone.\u201d\nRobinson started playing guitar at age nine and when he quickly outpaced his guitar instructor, began educating himself via the internet. At age 11 he was a touring guitarist and at just 13 years old, he won the Australian National Songwriting Competition. Within a couple of years he was touring regularly and sharing stages with artists such as Tommy and Phil Emmanuel, both of whom served as mentors. When a 16-year-old Robinson burned through a Chet-inflected medley of \u201cDay Tripper\u201d and \u201cLady Madonna\u201d in 2008 at the opening round of the nationally broadcast Australia\u2019s Got Talent television series competition, the entire house\u2014including the judges\u2014gave him a standing ovation.

Influenced by many different genres such as Rock, Folk, New Age and World, he utilizes unusual guitar tunings while incorporating percussive rhythms, harmonics, and finger-tapping with a piano-like approach that is both musically and visually stimulating.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Green\u2019s driving perfectionism to his music has brought him from an unknown street musician to gaining the attention of the Editors at Billboard Magazine who named him \"One of the best independent artists in the Midwest\" and winning the 2004\u00a0Guitar Idol Championship. He has opened shows for popular artists such as Ann Wilson (Heart), Pat Benatar, Poi Dog Pondering, Johnny Rivers, Muriel Anderson and Dire Straits Legacy to name a few.

Joining up with Lucy Dekay from Mystery Actions and Izzy Price (Velcro Lewis Group), this new project juts forth with a streamlined layered vocal and a wiry guitar tone, its a new direction, a subdued sonic approach with slithering dynamics and cavernous depth. Echoing solid 80\u2019s Gun Club & Fur Bible\u2019s chorus pedal-soaked vibes with a wall of dripping female vocals cascading over what sounds like a primitive and ominous lost Love and Rockets outtake, AWEFUL are a welcome new breath of fresh air to Chicago\u2019s underground sounds.

Joining up with Lucy Dekay from Mystery Actions and Izzy Price (Velcro Lewis Group), this new project juts forth with a streamlined layered vocal and a wiry guitar tone, its a new direction, a subdued sonic approach with slithering dynamics and cavernous depth. Echoing solid 80\u2019s Gun Club &amp; Fur Bible\u2019s chorus pedal-soaked vibes with a wall of dripping female vocals cascading over what sounds like a primitive and ominous lost Love and Rockets outtake, AWEFUL are a welcome new breath of fresh air to Chicago\u2019s underground sounds. Stepping aside from pandering to the pedantic tropes of endless post-punk operatives, AWEFUL draw out a more luscious &amp; moaning fuzzed-out experience, drilling their sticky repetition into your cortex with songs that pull you in immediately.

Bernard is blessed with his fathers soulful voice, spiritual devotion and a musical freedom, which experiments with the blues. Born in Chicago on November 26th 1965, he was the youngest of nine children. Bernard was first introduced to the roots of black music and the art of the electric guitar by his father, the late great Luther Allison. Like Ken Griffey Jr., hanging out in baseball locker rooms as a youth, Luther\u2019s son was a kid running on stage throughout the bands set. Experiences like that profoundly affect ones aspirations. \u201cThat\u2019s when I decided that I wanted to be up there with him. I think I was seven.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t start to play until I was ten years of age\u201d, Bernard recalled. \u201cI picked up the guitar and listened to my Dads records.\u201d While Luther was absent, his record collection played a major role in shaping his sons direction. Bernard listened to his dads influences like Magic Sam, Otis Rush, T-Bone Walker, Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins and B.B. King. He was also influenced by the next generation that followed; Stevie Ray Vaughan, Johnny Winter and Jimi Hendrix.\nBernard made his first appearance on record at age 13, when he played on a live LP his father recorded in Peoria, IL. \u201cWhen we moved to Peoria, Dad came home preparing to do his live album in Peoria. I hooked up the amplifier and guitar in the basement and started playing his first record.\u00a0Love Me Momma\u00a0note for note. He freaked out and said tonight you\u2019re gonna record with me. That was my first recording; I played \u2018You Don\u2019t Love Me No More\u2019 and \u2018Sweet Home Chicago\u2019.\u201d\nLuther bought Bernard his first guitar, a Fender Stratocaster, but he told him to first get an education. At eighteen years old after he graduated from high school, Bernard got a call from Koko Taylor asking him be her lead guitar player.\nBernard joined Koko Taylor\u2019s Blues Machine for three years. \u201cKoko and Pops Taylor taught me the do\u2019s and don\u2019t of the road; being really careful and watching people. They were like my Mom and Pops, I was able to experience different cultures, it was a great education. We backed Willie Dixon and Koko was the only group I played with besides my fathers band.\nThe1980s became Bernard\u2019s classroom as both a learner and a teacher. relationships during this period with Johnny Winter and Stevie Ray Vaughan expanded Bernard\u2019s guitar foundation. For a year and a half Bernard lived and played in London and Ontario. Then in 1989 Bernard flew to Europe to record with his father and where Bernard was asked to lead the band. Bernard, like his father, adopted permanent residence in France. A recording of the furious collaboration between Luther and Bernard can be heard on the Luther Allison album \u201cLets Try It Again\u201d on Ruf Records.\nWebsite\n\nFAQs\nPlease click here for a detailed FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.
