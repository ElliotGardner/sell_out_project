Brown's first professional singing job came at age 18 in New York City, running hootenannies (folksinger get-togethers) at the legendary Gerdes Folk City. After a year, Brown moved west to Los Angeles and Las Vegas, where he was a ghostwriter for Buck Ram, founder of the Platters. Tired of the fast-paced life, Brown traveled with a band for a few years, and even quit playing for a while before he moved back to Iowa and began writing songs and playing in midwestern clubs and coffeehouses.\nBrown's songwriting has been lauded by many, and his songs have been performed by Willie Nelson, Carlos Santana, Michael Johnson, Shawn Colvin, and Mary Chapin Carpenter. He has also recorded more than a dozen albums, including his 1986 release, Songs of Innocence and of Experience, when he put aside his own songwriting to set poems of William Blake to music. One Big Town, recorded in 1989, earned Brown three and a half stars in Rolling Stone, chart-topping status in AAA and The Gavin Report's Americana rankings and Brown's first Indie Award from NAIRD (National Association of Independent Record Distributors). The Poet Game, his 1994 CD, received another Indie award from NAIRD. His critically acclaimed 1996 release, Further In, was a finalist for the same award. Rolling Stone's four-star review of Further In called Brown \"a wickedly sharp observer of the human condition.\" 1997's Slant 6 Mind (Red House Records) earned Brown his second Grammy nomination. His latest CD, One Night (Red House), is a re-release of a 1983 live performance originally on Minneapolis' Coffeehouse Extempor\u00e9 Records.\nWebsite\n\nFAQs\nPLEASE CLICK HERE FOR A DETAILED FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

There\u2019s an obvious reason why the veteran guitarist\u2019s booking schedule is so jam-packed: Smiley knows how to have a good time and makes sure his audience does too. After 55 years on the local blues scene, Tillmon serves up the blues and soul standards that people never seem to stop craving, his rich vocals and fluid guitar backed by a band that keeps his grooves tight and right.\u00a0\nBorn Moses Tillmon in rural Jefferson County, Georgia, Smiley grew up on a hearty musical diet of gospel, country, and a little blues. His mother moved to Fort Lauderdale when he was ten; there he was exposed to calypso music, adding up to a singular list of influences. Tillmon took up guitar and was good enough by the dawn of the \u201860s to back Miami R&B singer Billy Miranda in the studio. He joined Sammy Ambrose & the Afro-Beats, a calypso-oriented band, touring from Canada to New York. Smiley bid the Afro-Beats adieu in 1962 and moved to Chicago. There he established himself on the blues circuit, playing with Billy \u201cThe Kid\u201d Emerson, Denise LaSalle, and other South Side luminaries until he opted for a day job in 1977. \nUpon his 2007 retirement, Smiley reverted to full-time musical status. He joined forces with bassist Tom Rezetko, and they\u2019ve been inseparable onstage ever since. Kate Moss shares guitar duties with Tillmon; married to another blues guitar standout, Nick Moss, Kate\u2019s sound is heavily influenced by Freddie King and Magic Sam (she fell in love with the blues at age 21 when she met Buddy Guy, and she\u2019s shared stages with Buddy, Jimmy Johnson, Eddie Shaw, and Lurrie Bell, just to name a few). Drummer George Baumann completes one of the Windy City\u2019s toughest blues combos, one that\u2019ll keep you smiling from ear to ear.\nwww.smileytillmonband.com\n", "html": "<P>The Venue is excited to present...

\u00a0SHOW: 7:30pm\nTo see a detailed seat map, please choose \"Tickets\" in the upper righthand corner, select your ticket choices & click \"view on map.\"\u00a0\n\nABOUT THE ARTISTS\nGenre: Folk\nThere's a bittersweet beauty to the passing of time -- the changes it brings are just as often heartbreaking as they are heartwarming. The inevitable tension that arises from that sway is Gretchen Peters' most trusted muse. \u201cThe years go by like days. Sometimes the days go by like years. And I don't know which one I hate the most,\u201d she sings in \u201cArguing with Ghosts,\u201d the hauntingly wistful opening cut on her new album, Dancing with the Beast.\nBetween the melody and the melancholy, the song sets the tone for all that is to come after and lifts the album over the high artistic bar set by her last outing, 2015's award-winning Blackbirds. Written with Matraca Berg and Ben Glover, \u201cArguing with Ghosts\u201d began, as so many songs do, with one small grain of inspiration. \u201cI think we were initially talking about how Nashville is changing, and Matraca said, 'I get lost in my hometown,'\u201d Peters recalls. \u201cAnd we went from there. Of course, it took on much more meaning, but I think that our starting point was just that sense of disorientation.\u201d\nWhether a single sentence or a simple setting, once planted, even the tiniest seed can grow into a vision unto itself. Strung together and populated with strong and broken female heroines, those vignettes make up Dancing with the Beast and, indeed, Peters' entire discography. \u201cThe pictures and the details come first, and I think that's kind of necessary because they're sort of like little bombs of emotion,\u201d she says. \u201cIt's like when you pull out a Polaroid that you haven't seen in 25 years, and your heart just kind of explodes because it brings back a whole world.\u201d\nOnce immersed in a world of emotion, Peters digs underneath to see what's fueling a particular fire, as she does so stunningly with the overwhelming insecurities of female adolescence in \u201cThe Boy from Rye.\u201d Knowing very well that most teenage girls endure objectification and sexualization, and their ensuing loss of confidence and power, Peters put her pen to paper and told that story.\n\"I remember being that age -- summers on Long Island at the beach, the sense of freedom, being with friends, encounters with boys, and the pressure of suddenly being in competition with your best friends.\u201d she offers. \u201cThere was a feeling that you\u2019d crossed some invisible line, and gone from being the subject in your own life, to being the object. It's a very treacherous time of life for girls.\u201d\nDancing with the Beast puts female characters at the fore, from teenage girls to old women. And intentionally so. With the 2017 Women's March and #MeToo Movement as bookends to her writing time, Peters knew that a feminist perspective would be the critical core of the record. \u201cThose two events just put everything -- as so many things in 2017 -- in really stark relief,\u201d she admits. \u201cYou can trace the feminist DNA in my songwriting back to 'Independence Day' and probably before. The thing that 2017 did is just put it front and center. It was very easy to kind of go to sleep for a while and just not think about that stuff because we were lulled into complacency for eight years.\u201d\nScenery, too, played a part in inspiring several cuts on the LP, most notably \u201cWichita\u201d and \u201cTruckstop Angel,\u201d both sketches of women doing whatever they have to do to stand up in a world built to hold them down. Once she knew where the songs were set, Peters and Glover dug into the details. \u201c'Wichita' was a lot like 'Blackbirds,' with me and Ben playing detective, like, 'What do you think happened here?'\u201d she says. \u201cI think I had the line, \u2019I hope I was the last thing that you saw that night in Wichita.' And the next questions were, \u2018What happened to this girl? How did we get there?'\u201d\n\u201cTruckstop Angel\u201d was an idea originally sparked 20-something years ago by a New Yorker article Peters read about people that lived in the wide open western reaches. \u201cThey just kind of went out there to get away from the world,\u201d she explains. \u201cI read this article and I was fascinated, and one of the things in the article was these truckstop prostitutes. And I just never got that out of my mind.\u201d Peters wrote around the idea a lot in those two decades, but never got to the heart of the story until she encountered such a character at a truckstop in Alabama. \u201cThis woman -- a girl, really, as I don't think she was more than 17 -- at 1:30 in the afternoon, walks through the lot in five-inch platform shoes and short shorts. And I just thought, 'Oh my God, that's the woman. That's her.'\u201d\nA title -- and an election -- were the beginnings of \u201cLowlands.\u201d Though Peters doesn't consider herself a political writer, she is politically minded and, therefore, knew she had to address the 2016 election and all that has happened since... but in her own way. \u201cI wrote on my chalkboard, 'Tell one little story,'\u201d she says. \u201cI just wrote it there, and I would stare at it for a while.\u201d\nSoon enough, the title came, bringing with it both a feeling and a place. \u201cThe description of the geography gave me a feeling inside of low clouds and general gloominess, but also the idea of laying low and staying low.\u201d To capture that mood, Peters crafted a multitude of verses, whittled them down, and stitched them together. \u201cIt has no chorus. It's nothing but verses. It's very Dylan-esque, in that way,\u201d she says. \u201cI just wanted it to drone on and on. We don't get a break. It's relentless, which is exactly how last year was.\u201d\nTo further drive the relentlessness, producer Doug Lancio built a foundation of programmed drums and synth drones, elements that purposely pushed Peters to the outer edges of her artistic comfort zone. \u201cWe struggled together over how far to go with that kind of thing,\u201d she confesses. \u201cI wanted 'Lowlands' to sound like the sound of dread. But the first mix we had going just didn't feel like me. It had to have some beauty in there, too.\u201d\nThe final female voice on the album comes from Peters' mother, who passed away in late 2016. \u201cLove That Makes a Cup of\fTea\u201d came out of a dream Peters had of her. \u201cI can't remember what the rest of the dream was, but she, in a reassuring way, held my hand and she said, 'You know, honey, there is love that makes a cup of tea,'\u201d Peters recounts. \u201cShe was the kind of person who would show you her love by baking you a pie or knitting you a sweater. She just said that in the dream, and I woke up and I thought, 'Okay, there it is. I'm going to write that.'\n\u201cI do remember feeling that I had to try to write something with hope in it,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt's not my strong suit. But I wanted that on this record, because I do think there's hope. I do see hope around me. I see a lot of trouble, too, but we have to try to find some light. Those are hard songs for me to write, but this was my mom's gift. She brought that to me.\u201d\nBeauty tempered by dread, sorrow buoyed by hope, these are the ever-present tugs of war that make life worth living and songs worth writing. And they are the over-riding themes that make Gretchen Peters one of her generation's most compelling singer/songwriters.\nWebsite\n\nFAQs\nPLEASE CLICK HERE FOR A DETAILED FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

The inevitable tension that arises from that sway is Gretchen Peters' most trusted muse. \u201cThe years go by like days. Sometimes the days go by like years. And I don't know which one I hate the most,\u201d she sings in \u201cArguing with Ghosts,\u201d the hauntingly wistful opening cut on her new album, Dancing with the Beast.</P>\n<P>Between the melody and the melancholy, the song sets the tone for all that is to come after and lifts the album over the high artistic bar set by her last outing, 2015's award-winning Blackbirds. Written with Matraca Berg and Ben Glover, \u201cArguing with Ghosts\u201d began, as so many songs do, with one small grain of inspiration. \u201cI think we were initially talking about how Nashville is changing, and Matraca said, 'I get lost in my hometown,'\u201d Peters recalls. \u201cAnd we went from there. Of course, it took on much more meaning, but I think that our starting point was just that sense of disorientation.\u201d</P>\n<P>Whether a single sentence or a simple setting, once planted, even the tiniest seed can grow into a vision unto itself. Strung together and populated with strong and broken female heroines, those vignettes make up Dancing with the Beast and, indeed, Peters' entire discography. \u201cThe pictures and the details come first, and I think that's kind of necessary because they're sort of like little bombs of emotion,\u201d she says. \u201cIt's like when you pull out a Polaroid that you haven't seen in 25 years, and your heart just kind of explodes because it brings back a whole world.\u201d</P>\n<P>Once immersed in a world of emotion, Peters digs underneath to see what's fueling a particular fire, as she does so stunningly with the overwhelming insecurities of female adolescence in \u201cThe Boy from Rye.\u201d Knowing very well that most teenage girls endure objectification and sexualization, and their ensuing loss of confidence and power, Peters put her pen to paper and told that story.</P>\n<P>\"I remember being that age -- summers on Long Island at the beach, the sense of freedom, being with friends, encounters with boys, and the pressure of suddenly being in competition with your best friends.\u201d she offers. \u201cThere was a feeling that you\u2019d crossed some invisible line, and gone from being the subject in your own life, to being the object. It's a very treacherous time of life for girls.\u201d</P>\n<P>Dancing with the Beast puts female characters at the fore, from teenage girls to old women. And intentionally so. With the 2017 Women's March and #MeToo Movement as bookends to her writing time, Peters knew that a feminist perspective would be the critical core of the record. \u201cThose two events just put everything -- as so many things in 2017 -- in really stark relief,\u201d she admits. \u201cYou can trace the feminist DNA in my songwriting back to 'Independence Day' and probably before. The thing that 2017 did is just put it front and center. It was very easy to kind of go to sleep for a while and just not think about that stuff because we were lulled into complacency for eight years.\u201d</P>\n<P>Scenery, too, played a part in inspiring several cuts on the LP, most notably \u201cWichita\u201d and \u201cTruckstop Angel,\u201d both sketches of women doing whatever they have to do to stand up in a world built to hold them down. Once she knew where the songs were set, Peters and Glover dug into the details. \u201c'Wichita' was a lot like 'Blackbirds,' with me and Ben playing detective, like, 'What do you think happened here?'\u201d she says. \u201cI think I had the line, \u2019I hope I was the last thing that you saw that night in Wichita.' And the next questions were, \u2018What happened to this girl? How did we get there?'\u201d</P>\n<P>\u201cTruckstop Angel\u201d was an idea originally sparked 20-something years ago by a New Yorker article Peters read about people that lived in the wide open western reaches. \u201cThey just kind of went out there to get away from the world,\u201d she explains. \u201cI read this article and I was fascinated, and one of the things in the article was these truckstop prostitutes. And I just never got that out of my mind.\u201d Peters wrote around the idea a lot in those two decades, but never got to the heart of the story until she encountered such a character at a truckstop in Alabama. \u201cThis woman -- a girl, really, as I don't think she was more than 17 -- at 1:30 in the afternoon, walks through the lot in five-inch platform shoes and short shorts. And I just thought, 'Oh my God, that's the woman. That's her.'\u201d</P>\n<P>A title -- and an election -- were the beginnings of \u201cLowlands.\u201d Though Peters doesn't consider herself a political writer, she is politically minded and, therefore, knew she had to address the 2016 election and all that has happened since... but in her own way. \u201cI wrote on my chalkboard, 'Tell one little story,'\u201d she says. \u201cI just wrote it there, and I would stare at it for a while.\u201d</P>\n<P>Soon enough, the title came, bringing with it both a feeling and a place. \u201cThe description of the geography gave me a feeling inside of low clouds and general gloominess, but also the idea of laying low and staying low.\u201d To capture that mood, Peters crafted a multitude of verses, whittled them down, and stitched them together. \u201cIt has no chorus. It's nothing but verses. It's very Dylan-esque, in that way,\u201d she says. \u201cI just wanted it to drone on and on. We don't get a break. It's relentless, which is exactly how last year was.\u201d</P>\n<P>To further drive the relentlessness, producer Doug Lancio built a foundation of programmed drums and synth drones, elements that purposely pushed Peters to the outer edges of her artistic comfort zone. \u201cWe struggled together over how far to go with that kind of thing,\u201d she confesses. \u201cI wanted 'Lowlands' to sound like the sound of dread. But the first mix we had going just didn't feel like me. It had to have some beauty in there, too.\u201d</P>\n<P>The final female voice on the album comes from Peters' mother, who passed away in late 2016. \u201cLove That Makes a Cup of<BR>\fTea\u201d came out of a dream Peters had of her. \u201cI can't remember what the rest of the dream was, but she, in a reassuring way, held my hand and she said, 'You know, honey, there is love that makes a cup of tea,'\u201d Peters recounts. \u201cShe was the kind of person who would show you her love by baking you a pie or knitting you a sweater. She just said that in the dream, and I woke up and I thought, 'Okay, there it is. I'm going to write that.'</P>\n<P>\u201cI do remember feeling that I had to try to write something with hope in it,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt's not my strong suit. But I wanted that on this record, because I do think there's hope. I do see hope around me. I see a lot of trouble, too, but we have to try to find some light. Those are hard songs for me to write, but this was my mom's gift. She brought that to me.\u201d</P>\n<P>Beauty tempered by dread, sorrow buoyed by hope, these are the ever-present tugs of war that make life worth living and songs worth writing. And they are the over-riding themes that make Gretchen Peters one of her generation's most compelling singer/songwriters.</P>\n<P><A HREF=\"https://www.gretchenpeters.com/news/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Website</A></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<H2><STRONG>FAQs</STRONG></H2>\n<P><EM><STRONG>PLEASE CLICK <A HREF=\"http://evanstonspace.com/faq\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">HERE</A> FOR A DETAILED FAQ.</STRONG></EM></P>\n<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0</STRONG>Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

Not a sister band, not a girl group, but a band fronted by three women, all talented singers, songwriters, and multi-instrumentalists in their own right: Kinsey Lee, Mackenzie Howe, and Sharon Silva, with drummer Nick Jones and bass player Nick Phakpiseth providing the Los Angeles-based band's rhythmic foundation. Like a harmony at its euphoric best, the leads' powerful -- and powerfully distinct -- voices merge to form a sound that can only be The Wild Reeds. On their third LP, Cheers, the band comes together to create an ode to the joys and pains of camaraderie.\nThe Wild Reeds' previous LPs, Blind and Brave (2014) and The World We Built (2017), and EPs, Best Wishes (2016) and New Ways To Die (2018), caught press attention from outlets including NPR Music (including a Tiny Desk Concert), Billboard, Rolling Stone Country, Noisey, and Garden & Gun, in addition to radio play from influential stations like KEXP and KCRW. And now arrives Cheers: a career highlight achieved by giving each writer considerable latitude, in the end creating a singular work out of three striking songwriting voices.\nOn Cheers, Lee, Howe, and Silva leaned into their differences for the first time, giving one another unprecedented amounts of freedom to execute their own songs. Each was allowed room to pursue her vision, while always leaving an open door for the other members to step in and collaborate. \"We decided to explore our individuality,\" says Howe. \"It was a scary thing for us, because when you have three writers, you often have to do your best to tame your differences and come to some sort of agreement writing-wise, sonically, stylistically. It was the first time we said, 'Screw that, why don't we just record the songs the way they should be done?'\"\nFor all the exploration on Cheers, the result is still tight and cohesive. The album makes room for infectious sing-along anthems (opening track \"Moving Target\"), tinges of R&B (\"Lose My Mind\"), lilting '60s pop-rock waltzes that build to resounding finishes (\"Cheers,\" \"Get Better\"), haunting balladry (\"Run and Hide,\" \"My Name\"), and even a gloriously hook-heavy track Lee sheepishly admits started as a tongue-in-cheek pop punk throwback (\"P.S. Nevermind\"). Every song sounds fresh, but all of them sound like The Wild Reeds. \"For me, it felt no holds barred, limitless, like I could step up to the plate,\" Silva says. \"The record feels very communal, and that's part of the reason we called it 'Cheers.' It felt like, 'Hey, we're all in this together and we're all focusing on what we're getting better at.' We could let go of what we're supposed to sound like and all reach a higher potential.\"\nCheers was born out of a strange and painful time, full of tough break-ups, family deaths, and discord within the band itself. The 13 songs are snapshots from that upheaval, touching on illness, therapy, heartbreak and disconnection from three perspectives. Some of Cheers' sunniest songs contain the darkest undercurrents, and The Wild Reeds don't shy away from sadness or open endings. The album creates beauty out of contradictions: It finds community in individuality, tenderness in confrontation, joy in the midst of grief and pain. Threaded throughout is a deep sense of gratitude for the band itself, and the songs became a way for the members to talk to each other -- an intimate language that was at times contentious, but in the end, healing. Silva explains, \"When Mack first showed us the song 'Get Better,' I was just walking back after an argument at practice. I came back in, she played us the song, and I sat on the floor and played the guitar line that's in the chorus...We just sat there and we played it and it was so soft and gentle, and it was exactly what I needed. I've always felt that way about the girls' songs, and that's what keeps the wheels rolling for me.\"\n\"We're really confrontational in our band, in a good way,\" Lee says. \"A lot of bands have fallen apart without even having a conversation. When you're 'married' to five different people for 10 years, things come up that you need to discuss with each other. I think we're all really good at challenging each other to grow and keep coming back to a place of love.\" Ultimately Cheers is hopeful, celebratory, and communal; life can break your heart, but friends can mend it. The Wild Reeds' trials have only strengthened their commitment to each other, and resulted in their strongest and most unified record to date.\nWebsite\n\n\nFAQs\nPLEASE CLICK\u00a0HERE\u00a0FOR A MORE DETAILED FAQ.\u00a0\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.
