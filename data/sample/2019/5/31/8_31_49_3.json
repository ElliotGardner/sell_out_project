(By the way - the food is delicious!\u00a0Lobster bisque, Hungarian sausage,\u00a0grilled sirloin beef burgers,\u00a0pulled\u00a0pork,\u00a0salads, sandwiches and\u00a0fantastic desserts.)\u00a0 If you love jazz and haven't been to the Eastgate Cafe before - why not stop in soon? We're only 11 miles due west from the Loop. Hop on 290 to the Austin Street exit and you'll be at our door in 20 minutes. We would love to see you! Just come in early if you can. The room is small, so we fill up fast. Here's a link to a video of the band to give you an idea of what it's like.\u00a0</SPAN><A HREF=\"https://youtu.be/i1QKsg4T8so\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://youtu.be/i1QKsg4T8so</A></P>"}, "id": "62438211371", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sunday-pro-jazz-jam-session-at-the-eastgate-cafe-tickets-62438211371?aff=ebapi", "start": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2019-06-02T16:00:00", "utc": "2019-06-02T21:00:00Z"}, "end": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2019-06-02T19:00:00", "utc": "2019-06-03T00:00:00Z"}, "organization_id": "113026184507", "created": "2019-05-27T16:51:42Z", "changed": "2019-05-27T16:51:45Z", "published": "2019-05-27T16:51:45Z", "capacity": null, "capacity_is_custom": null, "status": "live", "currency": "USD", "listed": true, "shareable": true, "online_event": false, "tx_time_limit": 480, "hide_start_date": false, "hide_end_date": false, "locale": "en_US", "is_locked": false, "privacy_setting": "unlocked", "is_series": false, "is_series_parent": false, "inventory_type": "limited", "is_reserved_seating": false, "show_pick_a_seat": false, "show_seatmap_thumbnail": false, "show_colors_in_seatmap_thumbnail": false, "source": "create_2.0", "is_free": true, "version": "3.0.0", "summary": "\"Should we go in town or to the Eastgate?\" That's\u00a0the question\u00a0\u00a0jazz lovers are asking themselves these days.

To say that the first full-length from the Melbourne quintet improves on their buzz-building EPs from the last few years would be an understatement: the promise those early releases hinted at has become fully realized here, with ten songs of urgent and passionate guitar pop that elicit warm memories of bands past, from the Go-Betweens' jangle to the charmingly lo-fi trappings of New Zealand's Flying Nun label. But don't mistake Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever for nostalgists: Hope Downs is the sound of a band finding its own collective voice.The hard-hitting debut is a testament to Rolling Blackouts C.F.\u2019s tight-knit and hard-working bonafides: prior to forming the band in 2013, singers/guitarists Fran Keaney, Tom Russo, and Joe White had played together in various garage bands, dating back to high school. \"Over the years, we built up our own sound and style, guitar pop songs with bits of punk and country\u201d says Keaney. \u201cThen when we started this band, with Joe Russo [Tom\u2019s brother] on bass, Marcel [Tussie, Joe White's then-housemate] on drums, we had this immediate chemistry. We started to let the songs go where they wanted to go\u201d.The band's first gigs included friends' bars and old shopfronts. After a split EP with You Yangs (another Russo brother's band), released in the form of a frisbee, they self-released the\u00a0Talk Tight\u00a0EP in 2015, with Sydney-based record label Ivy League giving it a wider release the following year. Talk Tight garnered plaudits from critics, including legendary rock scribe Robert Christgau. In 2017, Sub Pop would join the effort, helping to release\u00a0The French Press\u00a0EP, bringing the band's chugging and tuneful non-linear indie rock to the rest of the world as they settled into their sound with remarkable ease.\u00a0Hope Downs\u00a0was largely written over the past year in the band's Melbourne rehearsal room where their previous releases were also written and recorded. The band's core trio of songwriters\u2014 Fran Keaney, Joe White, and Tom Russo\u2014hunkered down and wrote as the chaos of the world outside unavoidably seeped into the songwriting process. \"We were feeling like we were in a moment where the sands were shifting and the world was getting a lot weirder. There was a general sense that things were coming apart at the seams and people around us were too\u201d. Russo explains.\u00a0\u201cThe songs on this album are like a collection of postcards about wider things that were going on through the lens of these small characters.\"\u00a0The album title, taken from the name of a vast open cut mine in the middle of Australia, refers to the feeling of \u201cstanding at the edge of the void of the big unknown, and finding something to hold on to.\u201dWith recording sessions largely taking place in the Australian winter of 2017, the band escaped the Melbourne frost and headed to drummer Marcel Tussie\u2019s hometown in Northern New South Wales. \"We were right at the foot of this beautiful mountain next to a creek,\" says White. \"We could play out into the bush through the night\u201d.\u00a0\"We didn't really want to record in a studio,\" says Keaney. \u201cWe thought we'd get away up North, somewhere where it was warm, and record the songs live in the same room. We wanted to make sure it sounded like us,\" White explains. With the help of engineer/producer Liam Judson and his portable setup, the band recorded and co-produced these ten guitar pop gems over the course of two weeks.Hope Downs\u00a0possesses a robust full-band sound that's all the more impressive considering the band's studio avoidance tendencies. If you loved\u00a0Talk Tight\u00a0and\u00a0The French Press, you certainly won't be disappointed here\u2014but you might also be surprised at how the band\u2019s sound has grown. There's a richness and weight to these songs that was previously only hinted at, from the skyscraping chorus of \u2018Sister's Jeans\u2019 to the thrilling climax of album closer \u2018The Hammer\u2019.The first single \u2018Mainland\u2019 follows Tom Russo\u2019s pilgrimage to the island of his grandparent\u2019s birth, reflecting on his own love and privilege while a refugee crisis unfolds not far away, while second cut \u2018Talking Straight\u2019 wonders \u201cwhere the silence comes from, where the space originates\u201d, and suggests loneliness be faced together.And then there's the sprawling overture \u2018An Air Conditioned Man\u2019, which portrays the slow burning panic of a salaryman and features some beautifully tricky guitar work weaving in and out of frame as well as a surprisingly effective spoken-word section from Tom Russo during its closing moments. \u201cAs the world around him gets faker and faker, he realises he's getting further away from the idealism of his youth.\"Indeed,\u00a0Hope Downs\u00a0is as much about the people that populate the world around us\u2014their stories, perspectives, and hopes in the face of disillusionment\u2014as it is about the state of things at large. It's a record that focuses on finding the bright spots at a time when cynicism all too often feels like the natural state. Rolling Blackouts C.F. are here to remind us to keep our feet on the ground\u2014and\u00a0Hope Downs\u00a0is as delicious a taste of terra firma as you're going to get from a rock band right now.\u00a0", "html": "<P>It's rare that a band's debut album sounds as confident and self-assured as Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever's\u00a0Hope Downs.

ARTIST\nGenre:\u00a0Folk-rock\u00a0\nFor many bands, and especially those who\u2019ve been together for several years, recognizing maturation, progress or palpable evolution is a daunting task. Is it continued creative accomplishment that signals progression? Or perhaps it\u2019s profitable commercial endeavors? The answer is often quite unclear. Six years, two albums and countless gigs after first forming as a band, River Whyless, the North Carolina-bred folk-rock outfit has discovered their evolution is a subtler albeit monumentally important one. Deep in the throes of writing and recording their bold new album, Kindness, A Rebel , the four musicians reached a necessary and collective understanding. Namely: this band is their lifeblood, their family and their love. To that end, with unspoken acceptance, the members of River Whyless, each songwriters in their own right, collectively put aside their respective egos, coalesced around each other\u2019s creative vision, and fully embraced the beauty of their enduring partnership.\n\u201cIt was a feeling of openness and hope and acceptance,\u201d says singer-violinist Halli Anderson of the multi-week sessions with producer Paul Butler (Devendra Banhart, Michael Kiwanuka) that resulted in some of River Whyless\u2019 most dynamic, genre-bending and heartfelt material yet. Creatives regularly waver between honoring their own creation and rallying around larger ideas for the benefit of the group. But with every member of River Whyless now charting a life outside the band, and also writing on their own, when coming together to record Kindness it was never more crucial they be open and honest with each other.\nDespite having never felt more unified in their vision for the future, much as they\u2019ve navigated their freewheeling career to date, River Whyless is choosing to not predict what lies ahead. Allowing their creative union to continue guiding them, they insist, remains their only constant. \u201cIt feels like you\u2019re on a journey with your family,\u201d McWalters says of the satisfaction of being in a band like River Whyless. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful thing.\u201d\nWebsite\n\nFAQs\nPlease click here for a detailed FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

Choose the ticket based on which artist you are coming to see!\u00a0Support from Christian JaLon & Krystal MetcalfeJohari Noelle is a Southside, Chicago-bred singer renowned as much for the timbre of her voice as her biting honesty. The daughter of a DJ, she cut her teeth performing in choirs and musical theatre during her formative years. Her creative resume has since grown to include acting credits on the hit FOX television series Empire and Proven Innocent and the React II campaign from NIKE, Inc. She is a multi-disciplinary artist who rejects categorization and embraces topics like insecurity and resilience at a time when popular culture and social media have encouraged people to perform perfection. Buoyed by an angelic voice with a distinctively smoky bottom register, Johari Noelle distinguishes herself with a clarity of thought that cuts through lush arrangements to capture and ultimately translate hearts. Citing a bevy of influences from Sade, Janet Jackson to Beyonce, Frank Ocean and Amy Winehouse, Noelle was also influenced by the city\u2019s storied jazz and blues traditions. Challenging the modern musical narrative, she counters the abundance of rap dominating popular notions of the Windy City sound with a titanic vocal talent. Her natural ability first catapulted her from singing covers on YouTube to national television in 2015 when she joined the cast of the BET docu-series Chasing Destiny. The national talent search launched to form an all-girl group found Noelle being mentored by singer Kelly Rowland (of Destiny\u2019s Child) and famed choreographer Frank Gatson Jr. After taping concluded for the show, the Northern Illinois University alum returned to Chicago to reconnect with her artistic purpose. Dissatisfied with the routine of a day job, she reinstated herself as a fixture on the city\u2019s indie music scene where she played a pair of solo performances for Sofar Sounds in 2017 and 2018, opened for Sir The Baptist and placed second in the Chicago Next Showcase. She also began recording with a variety of producers and engineer Matt Hennessy of VSOP Studios. The songs they created together populate Noelle\u2019s forthcoming solo debut project Things You Can\u2019t Say Out Loud. Derived from candid conversations with herself about the things in life that are not so easily digestible, the extended play release is an internal dialogue set to music. Eschewing the refrain du jour, she trades the easy tropes of objectification, self-indulgence and gross materialism for introspection, complex emotion and the labor \u2013\u2013 not just the romance \u2013\u2013 endemic to the act of love. Johari Noelle\u2019s writing champions sisterhood and chronicles her life as a woman climbing the ladder in the music industry. Hers is a nuanced and challenging sound reflective of the careful thought, generosity of spirit and abiding compassion she applies to personal relationships. Literally singing all of the things people often cannot bear to say aloud, she gives voice to the fraught moments and adverse circumstances affecting mankind. More importantly, by setting her own internal dialogue to music she realizes her own freedom and is empowered to set others free.\u201cThis music is about getting out how I feel and being very present in that moment. It\u2019s important for me to embrace myself in a way that empowers me to feel each emotion and remain in touch with myself. I want people to know that they aren\u2019t alone in what they are feeling. I want to convey a sense of relatability. I feel like a lot of music isn\u2019t within reach for listeners. It sounds good but people can\u2019t connect to it deeply. If I perform a song about quitting my job, they can latch onto it because they\u2019ve quit a job over some B.S. or wanted to quit a job and couldn\u2019t. Maybe they\u2019ve been in love and didn\u2019t understand how to express it. Or are in a relationship with someone and they don\u2019t understand how to love that person or how they receive or prefer to give love. They don\u2019t speak their love language. My story connects to yours. My songs are meant to touch people. I want you to feel peace and comfort. I want to create something that creates conversation or community through shared experiences. It isn\u2019t a niche message for a niche crowd. I\u2019m reaching for humanity in my music.\u201d", "html": "<P>All Ages</P><P>Doors 7:00pm</P><P>Ends 9:30pm</P><P>General Admission - $7</P><P>All tickets are general admission.

Her creative resume has since grown to include acting credits on the hit FOX television series Empire and Proven Innocent and the React II campaign from NIKE, Inc. She is a multi-disciplinary artist who rejects categorization and embraces topics like insecurity and resilience at a time when popular culture and social media have encouraged people to perform perfection. Buoyed by an angelic voice with a distinctively smoky bottom register, Johari Noelle distinguishes herself with a clarity of thought that cuts through lush arrangements to capture and ultimately translate hearts. Citing a bevy of influences from Sade, Janet Jackson to Beyonce, Frank Ocean and Amy Winehouse, Noelle was also influenced by the city\u2019s storied jazz and blues traditions. Challenging the modern musical narrative, she counters the abundance of rap dominating popular notions of the Windy City sound with a titanic vocal talent. Her natural ability first catapulted her from singing covers on YouTube to national television in 2015 when she joined the cast of the BET docu-series Chasing Destiny. The national talent search launched to form an all-girl group found Noelle being mentored by singer Kelly Rowland (of Destiny\u2019s Child) and famed choreographer Frank Gatson Jr. After taping concluded for the show, the Northern Illinois University alum returned to Chicago to reconnect with her artistic purpose. Dissatisfied with the routine of a day job, she reinstated herself as a fixture on the city\u2019s indie music scene where she played a pair of solo performances for Sofar Sounds in 2017 and 2018, opened for Sir The Baptist and placed second in the Chicago Next Showcase. She also began recording with a variety of producers and engineer Matt Hennessy of VSOP Studios. The songs they created together populate Noelle\u2019s forthcoming solo debut project Things You Can\u2019t Say Out Loud. Derived from candid conversations with herself about the things in life that are not so easily digestible, the extended play release is an internal dialogue set to music. Eschewing the refrain du jour, she trades the easy tropes of objectification, self-indulgence and gross materialism for introspection, complex emotion and the labor \u2013\u2013 not just the romance \u2013\u2013 endemic to the act of love. Johari Noelle\u2019s writing champions sisterhood and chronicles her life as a woman climbing the ladder in the music industry. Hers is a nuanced and challenging sound reflective of the careful thought, generosity of spirit and abiding compassion she applies to personal relationships. Literally singing all of the things people often cannot bear to say aloud, she gives voice to the fraught moments and adverse circumstances affecting mankind. More importantly, by setting her own internal dialogue to music she realizes her own freedom and is empowered to set others free.</P><P><BR></P><P>\u201cThis music is about getting out how I feel and being very present in that moment. It\u2019s important for me to embrace myself in a way that empowers me to feel each emotion and remain in touch with myself. I want people to know that they aren\u2019t alone in what they are feeling. I want to convey a sense of relatability. I feel like a lot of music isn\u2019t within reach for listeners. It sounds good but people can\u2019t connect to it deeply. If I perform a song about quitting my job, they can latch onto it because they\u2019ve quit a job over some B.S. or wanted to quit a job and couldn\u2019t. Maybe they\u2019ve been in love and didn\u2019t understand how to express it. Or are in a relationship with someone and they don\u2019t understand how to love that person or how they receive or prefer to give love. They don\u2019t speak their love language. My story connects to yours. My songs are meant to touch people. I want you to feel peace and comfort. I want to create something that creates conversation or community through shared experiences. It isn\u2019t a niche message for a niche crowd. I\u2019m reaching for humanity in my music.\u201d</P>"}, "id": "60212123081", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/johari-noelle-the-promontory-tickets-60212123081?aff=ebapi", "vanity_url": "https://joharinoelle.eventbrite.com", "start": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2019-06-05T19:00:00", "utc": "2019-06-06T00:00:00Z"}, "end": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2019-06-06T06:00:00", "utc": "2019-06-06T11:00:00Z"}, "organization_id": "224195095473", "created": "2019-04-10T18:11:15Z", "changed": "2019-05-31T12:15:36Z", "published": "2019-04-11T15:00:10Z", "capacity": null, "capacity_is_custom": null, "status": "live", "currency": "USD", "listed": true, "shareable": false, "online_event": false, "tx_time_limit": 480, "hide_start_date": false, "hide_end_date": true, "locale": "en_US", "is_locked": false, "privacy_setting": "unlocked", "is_series": false, "is_series_parent": false, "inventory_type": "limited", "is_reserved_seating": false, "show_pick_a_seat": false, "show_seatmap_thumbnail": false, "show_colors_in_seatmap_thumbnail": false, "source": "queue", "is_free": false, "version": "4.0.0", "summary": "All AgesDoors 7:00pmEnds 9:30pmGeneral Admission - $7All tickets are general admission.
