Since the release of their first 7-inch single, \"Bullfrog Boogaloo\" in 2001, The Diplomats have been mining America's vast deposits of soul music to create a sound all their own -- a spare but-spicy groove sired equally by progenitors such as Booker T., James Brown and The Funk Brothers. After 3 full-length albums as an instrumental outfit; \"Instrumental Action Soul\" (2001) on their own Prescription Records, and both \"Let\u00b4s Cool One\" (2003) and \"Destination Get Down!\" (2005) on the mighty Estrus Records, The Diplomats expand the family with a new set of soul stunners they call The Diplomettes, for the self-titled \"The Diplomats Of Solid Sound feat. The Diplomettes\" (2008) out on Record Kicks / Pravda and produced by Lack Of Afro from Freestyle Records.\nWith each release The Diplomats Of Solid Sound grew in sophistication and depth as they ingested the sounds of 60s soul, R&B and deep funk. Their albums captured the band in its natural habitat, a dimly lit bar where people appreciate a good smoke, a vodka gimlet and a funky little combo that knows how to get the cats and kittens out of their seats and onto the dancefloor. The sound got the boys a gig backing R&B legend Andre Williams, with whom they cut \"Aphrodisiac\", released in 2006 on both Pravda Records and the Spanish Vampisoul label . That same year the group asked 3 three gifted soul sirens (Sarah Cram, Katherine Ruestow, and Abigail Sawyer) aka The Diplomettes to join the band, which brings us up to date. With a slightly renewed line-up (original drummer Jim Viner is replaced by Paul Kresowik and the departure of Abbie Sawyer leaves Sarah Cram and Katharine Ruestow as The Diplomettes), the group prepares to launch their latest full-length and fifth album, \"What Goes Around Comes Around\" in October 2010, confirming their standing as one of the more prolific funk and soul groups of the contemporary scene. Prepare for a supercharged new set of prime cuts for the dancefloor guaranteed to groove its way into your head and your ass -- and get both moving fast!\nThe band has shared stages with Sharon Jones, Robert Walter, Wilco, The New Mastersounds and The James Taylor Quartet and toured in Italy, France, and Spain. DOSS tracks have been played on The John Peel Show and The Craig Charles Funk And Soul Show on BBC, and have served as soundtrack music for many television programs, including \"Reaper\" (WB Network), \"Breaking Bonaduce\" (VH1), \"Made\" (MTV), \"My Super Sweet 16\" (MTV), \"The Osbournes\" (MTV), \"Parental Control\" (MTV), \"Punk'D\" (MTV), \"Room Raiders\" (MTV), \"Cathouse\" (HBO), and \"Sons Of Hollywood\" (A&E).\n\nTHE IMPERIAL SOUND is a swinging pop band with roots in 1970's AM radio, Chicago soul, and first-rate song craft. Kenn Goodman (keyboards) and Rick Mosher (guitars and vocals) have been partners in a variety of musical ventures, from the Chicago-based Pravda Records store and label to the legendary trash-rock trio The New Duncan Imperials, for many years. Their latest incarnation, as the founders of The Imperial Sound (sometimes shortened to ImpSo by its fans), puts them at the center of a group of seasoned musicians with years of experience and a drive for self-reinvention.\nThe band\u2019s debut full-length album was recorded with Mike Hagler at Kingsize Sound Labs (Wilco\u2019s Summerteeth and Mermaid Avenue discs, Neko Case, Mekons, Waco Brothers) and mixed by John \u201cStrawberry\u201d Fields (everyone from Miley Cyrus and Demi Lovato to the Dollyrots). The twelve songs on the Imperial Sound's debut forge an immediately identifiable sound and style: songs bristling with pop hooks, taut arrangements driven by an all-star horn section, heavenly harmonies courtesy of a who's-who in Chicago pop. Guests on the album include Peter Himmelman, Poi Dog Pondering's Dag Juhlin, Singing legends Kelly Hogan and Nora O'Conner, and Kathy Ruestow.\nThe roots of this band are long and strong. Kenn Goodman and Rick Mosher met in college, where they shared a love of both music and good-natured provocation; they started a new wave band, and also published a phony college newspaper that ridiculed frat culture. Their band played mostly originals, unusual for the scene, and they had success on the local circuit, playing virtually anywhere and anytime, for any number of people (this era included an opening slot for the biker band Black Oak Arkansas). The band recorded two 45's, got their songs played on the local radio station, and totally ruled the scene.\nBut Kenn and Rick had bigger ideas. Soon they had dropped out of college, started a new band, and relocated to Chicago, where Kenn led the way in starting Pravda Records, a label and store located in the Cabaret Metro building. Soon Pravda was one of the most recognized record stores in the city. Kenn and Rick were busy with the Pravda label as well, releasing records by a number of bands. During this time the label was perhaps best known for producing a pair of tribute albums to K-tel Records, a nostalgic compilation of 1970's one-hit wonders performed by well-known local and national bands including The Smashing Pumpkins, Mojo Nixon, and The Young Fresh Fellows.\nAlong with running the store and the label, Kenn and Rick were busy with their new band, The Service, which by now included Gary Schepers on bass. The Service was a mainstay of Chicago's new-music club scene, and the band's four albums are full of sturdy, no-nonsense songs and inventive arrangements. Their music has aged well, as critic Peter Margasak noted in the Chicago Reader on the occasion of Pravda's 25th Anniversary: I still have an awful lot of underground rock records from the mid- to late 80s, before media and marketing geniuses cooked up terms like \"alt-rock\" and \"indie rock,\" and few of them have aged as well as my Service albums. They were the epitome of the midwestern rock of the time: unfussy, exuberant, and with a certain elegance in its simplicity.\nThe Service was a hardscrabble band with more songs and passion than money in the bank, but they toured constantly despite $2 per-diems and shared single motel rooms (a past memorialized in the Imperial Sound song \u201c6 to a Room\u201d). They had a good run, but after several years the pressure got to them. Kenn, Rick, and drummer John Smith split off to form The New Duncan Imperials, a band as noisy and irreverent as the Service were earnest and poetic. NDI enjoyed a meteoric rise to the top of the city's club scene, and were soon selling out shows throughout the country; they made inroads into Europe as well. Their recorded output \u2014 10 releases in all -- is an avalanche of chaotic, absurdist power pop. These days the band is sometimes referred to as \u201clegendary.\u201d No one is arguing.\nFast forward: NDI performs when the feeling is right. Kenn runs Pravda as a successful indie label and publishing company. Rick is still writing songs. The two men share a history and a sensibility, and now they have a new project in which to pour their remarkable energy. The Imperial Sound is a band with years of shared experience, yet they sound anything but tired -- the songs are fresh and the vibe is driving and melodic. This may be a band with a past, but it's also a band with a future.\nWebsite\n\nFAQs\nPlease click here for a detailed FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

forged a consistent, rock-solid aesthetic identity. Looking to commemorate his 66th year, Scofield penned twelve original compositions and formed a swinging new group to record and tour the music. Rising star Gerald Clayton was an obvious choice on piano, an instrument central to the new tunes. The connection between Scofield and drummer Bill Stewart strengthens as the decades pass. It was Stewart who introduced bassist Vicente Archer to the project, having worked with him on a Nicholas Payton recording. Scofield is thrilled with the group and in addition to the musical combustion, especially enjoys the inter-generational quality - sixties, fifties, forties and thirties represented! Scofield will tour with the following group through 2019, his next Verve recording COMBO 66 releasing in September 2018.\nA triple Grammy award winning artist with fan bases in many camps and 40 plus recordings to his credit, SCOFIELD has expressed himself in the vernacular of bebop, blues, jazz-funk, organ jazz, acoustic chamber jazz, electronically tinged groove music, jam band style and orchestral ensembles with ease and enthusiasm. With multiple Grammy nominations and named an Officier dans L\u2019Ordre des Arts and Lettres by France, Scofield tours the world approximately 200 days per year with his own groups. Touring the world approximately 200 days per year, he has shared stage and studio in the company of Miles Davis, Tony Williams, Jim Hall, Ron Carter, Herbie Hancock, Joe Henderson, Dave Holland, Charlie Haden, Pat Metheny, Jack DeJohnette, Joe Lovano, Brad Mehldau, Eddie Harris, John Mayer, Phil Lesh, Aaron Neville, Mavis Staples and MMW among many music legends.\nOriginally from Des Moines, Iowa, born 18 October 1966 , drummer and composer BILL STEWART has performed and recorded with many well known musicians, including Scofield, Pat Metheny, Maceo Parker, Larry Goldings, Joe Lovano, Charlie Haden, Joe Henderson, Michael Brecker, Kevin Hays, Bill Carrothers, Chris Potter, Marc Copland, Lee Konitz and many others. He has also recorded several cds as a leader, including \"Snide Remarks\"(Blue Note), which was named one of the top ten CDs of 1995 by The New York Times, and the 2008 release, \"Incandescence\" on Pirouet records, featuring his trio with Larry Goldings and Kevin Hays. Bill is a co-leader of the critically acclaimed Trio BERNSTEIN/GOLDINGS/STEWART who have recorded three albums.\nPianist Gerald Clayton was born in the Netherlands 11 May 1984. Raised in California and son of acclaimed jazz bassist, arranger and bandleader John Clayton. He attended the L.A. County High School for the Arts and graduated from the USC Thornton School of Music, followed by a move to New York City.. In 2006, Gerald received the second place prize in the prestigious Thelonius Monk Institute of Jazz Piano Competition. Three years of extensive touring and recording with trumpeter Roy Hargrove between 2006 and 2009, Gerald also appeared on recordings by several other artists, such as Diana Krall, Ambrose Akinmusire, Kendrick Scott, Melissa Morgan, Terell Stafford & Dick Oatts, and more recently Michael Rodriguez, Dayna Stephens, Terri Lyne Carrington, and the Clayton Brothers Quintet, led by his father and his uncle, saxophonist Jeff Clayton. Gerald continues to perform regularly with the Clayton Brothers. Twice nominated for Grammy Awards, Clayton has released three recordings as a leader. In 2009, he released Two-Shade, his debut album as a leader, followed by his second album, Bond: The Paris Sessions. Third record, Life Forum, released in April 2013 and his latest 2017's Tributary Tales on Motema has released to high praise.\nBassist VICENTE ARCHER was born in Woodstock, NY, and embraced the rich cultural arts of his historical town by listening to local great jazz artists Dave Holland, Jimmy Cobb, Jack DeJohnette. He began his musical career on guitar at age sixteen primarily self-taught. Upon graduation from high school, Vicente was accepted to The New England Conservatory (NEC) in Boston, MA, where he majored in Jazz Studies. His instructors included guitarist Gene Bertoncini, saxophonist Jerry Bergonzi, and Latin/Jazz pianist Danilo Perez. After his first year at NEC, Vicente transferred to Boston's Northeastern University where he switched from guitar to acoustic bass. Within one year of switching to the bass, alto saxophonist Donald Harrison asked Vicente to join his group, recording on Harrison's Impulse! release, Free to Be. While still in college, Vicente also began performing in the Eric Reed Trio. After earning a business degree in Management Information Systems and Business Management in June 2000, Vicente moved to New York City where he soon began performing and touring with the likes of Kenny Garrett, Terence Blanchard, Tom Harrell, Freddie Hubbard, Marlena Shaw, Deborah Cox, Louis Hayes, Curtis Fuller, Mark Whitfield, Roy Haynes, Geri Allen, Stanley Jordan, Karrin Allyson, Wycliffe Gordon, Stefon Harris, Janis Siegel, Lewis Nash, Carl Allen, and The Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra w/ Wynton Marsalis, Robert Glasper and Nicholas Payton. Vicente Archer has emerged as one of today's profound new voices on the bass.\u00a0\nWebsite\n\nFAQs\nPLEASE CLICK HERE FOR A DETAILED FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

Looking to commemorate his 66th year, Scofield penned twelve original compositions and formed a swinging new group to record and tour the music. Rising star Gerald Clayton was an obvious choice on piano, an instrument central to the new tunes. The connection between Scofield and drummer Bill Stewart strengthens as the decades pass. It was Stewart who introduced bassist Vicente Archer to the project, having worked with him on a Nicholas Payton recording. Scofield is thrilled with the group and in addition to the musical combustion, especially enjoys the inter-generational quality - sixties, fifties, forties and thirties represented! Scofield will tour with the following group through 2019, his next Verve recording COMBO 66 releasing in September 2018.\nA triple Grammy award winning artist with fan bases in many camps and 40 plus recordings to his credit, SCOFIELD has expressed himself in the vernacular of bebop, blues, jazz-funk, organ jazz, acoustic chamber jazz, electronically tinged groove music, jam band style and orchestral ensembles with ease and enthusiasm. With multiple Grammy nominations and named an Officier dans L\u2019Ordre des Arts and Lettres by France, Scofield tours the world approximately 200 days per year with his own groups. Touring the world approximately 200 days per year, he has shared stage and studio in the company of Miles Davis, Tony Williams, Jim Hall, Ron Carter, Herbie Hancock, Joe Henderson, Dave Holland, Charlie Haden, Pat Metheny, Jack DeJohnette, Joe Lovano, Brad Mehldau, Eddie Harris, John Mayer, Phil Lesh, Aaron Neville, Mavis Staples and MMW among many music legends.\nOriginally from Des Moines, Iowa, born 18 October 1966 , drummer and composer BILL STEWART has performed and recorded with many well known musicians, including Scofield, Pat Metheny, Maceo Parker, Larry Goldings, Joe Lovano, Charlie Haden, Joe Henderson, Michael Brecker, Kevin Hays, Bill Carrothers, Chris Potter, Marc Copland, Lee Konitz and many others. He has also recorded several cds as a leader, including \"Snide Remarks\"(Blue Note), which was named one of the top ten CDs of 1995 by The New York Times, and the 2008 release, \"Incandescence\" on Pirouet records, featuring his trio with Larry Goldings and Kevin Hays. Bill is a co-leader of the critically acclaimed Trio BERNSTEIN/GOLDINGS/STEWART who have recorded three albums.\nPianist Gerald Clayton was born in the Netherlands 11 May 1984. Raised in California and son of acclaimed jazz bassist, arranger and bandleader John Clayton. He attended the L.A. County High School for the Arts and graduated from the USC Thornton School of Music, followed by a move to New York City.. In 2006, Gerald received the second place prize in the prestigious Thelonius Monk Institute of Jazz Piano Competition. Three years of extensive touring and recording with trumpeter Roy Hargrove between 2006 and 2009, Gerald also appeared on recordings by several other artists, such as Diana Krall, Ambrose Akinmusire, Kendrick Scott, Melissa Morgan, Terell Stafford & Dick Oatts, and more recently Michael Rodriguez, Dayna Stephens, Terri Lyne Carrington, and the Clayton Brothers Quintet, led by his father and his uncle, saxophonist Jeff Clayton. Gerald continues to perform regularly with the Clayton Brothers. Twice nominated for Grammy Awards, Clayton has released three recordings as a leader. In 2009, he released Two-Shade, his debut album as a leader, followed by his second album, Bond: The Paris Sessions. Third record, Life Forum, released in April 2013 and his latest 2017's Tributary Tales on Motema has released to high praise.\nBassist VICENTE ARCHER was born in Woodstock, NY, and embraced the rich cultural arts of his historical town by listening to local great jazz artists Dave Holland, Jimmy Cobb, Jack DeJohnette. He began his musical career on guitar at age sixteen primarily self-taught. Upon graduation from high school, Vicente was accepted to The New England Conservatory (NEC) in Boston, MA, where he majored in Jazz Studies. His instructors included guitarist Gene Bertoncini, saxophonist Jerry Bergonzi, and Latin/Jazz pianist Danilo Perez. After his first year at NEC, Vicente transferred to Boston's Northeastern University where he switched from guitar to acoustic bass. Within one year of switching to the bass, alto saxophonist Donald Harrison asked Vicente to join his group, recording on Harrison's Impulse! release, Free to Be. While still in college, Vicente also began performing in the Eric Reed Trio. After earning a business degree in Management Information Systems and Business Management in June 2000, Vicente moved to New York City where he soon began performing and touring with the likes of Kenny Garrett, Terence Blanchard, Tom Harrell, Freddie Hubbard, Marlena Shaw, Deborah Cox, Louis Hayes, Curtis Fuller, Mark Whitfield, Roy Haynes, Geri Allen, Stanley Jordan, Karrin Allyson, Wycliffe Gordon, Stefon Harris, Janis Siegel, Lewis Nash, Carl Allen, and The Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra w/ Wynton Marsalis, Robert Glasper and Nicholas Payton. Vicente Archer has emerged as one of today's profound new voices on the bass.\u00a0\nWebsite\n\nFAQs\nPLEASE CLICK HERE FOR A DETAILED FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.
