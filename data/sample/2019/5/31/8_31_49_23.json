Chris Pureka is a Portland-based singer-songwriter whose body of work has resonated deeply with these seemingly disparate milieus. Her bold vulnerability in processing the intimacies of her life in song has long appealed to those listeners who crave authenticity. Now, five years coming, she shares with us another powerful entry in her life\u2019s work, her sixth release, the aptly titled, Back in the Ring.\nChris\u2019s elegant emotionality as a vocalist, and her flair and immediacy as a lyricist have garnered her favorable comparisons to Gillian Welch, Ryan Adams, Bruce Springsteen, and Patty Griffin. She\u2019s earned accolades from such distinguished taste-making outlets as The New York Times, Paste, Magnet, Billboard.com, and The AllMusic Guide. She\u2019s shared the stage with such diverse and esteemed artists as Dar Williams, The Lumineers, The Cowboy Junkies, Gregory Alan Isakov, Martin Sexton, and Ani DiFranco. Along the way, Chris has remained fiercely independent, selling nearly 50,000 albums through her own label, Sad Rabbit Records.\nChris\u2019s journey in music mirrors her path toward self-discovery. At 16, writing songs became a way of journaling. \u201cI was shy and introverted, and songwriting was a very personal process. I never had any intention of performing,\u201d she shares. Post high school, she went on to complete a biology degree at Wesleyan University, and afterwards, worked in a microbiology research lab at Smith College. Meanwhile, she established a music career parallel to her biology work through touring and issuing a clutch of well-received indie releases. In 2006, when Chris found herself turning down too many opportunities as a musician, she shifted her priorities to become a full-time artist.\nHer latest album, Back in the Ring, is Chris\u2019s first studio full length since 2010\u2019s critically acclaimed How I Learned to See in the Dark. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in releasing songs I can\u2019t get behind or records I don\u2019t love,\u201d she says of the five-year span between albums. The title of her latest playfully suggests something of an artistic comeback, but it also references the album\u2019s themes of relationship conflict and making the decision to fight back against dark inner demons.\n\u201cMy music is the outward expression of the work I\u2019m doing internally. What I do comes from my experiences, and I strive to express these experiences authentically. Speaking my truth, and being myself, is the way that I connect with people,\u201d Chris confides. Her rise as an esteemed artist with captivating emotional integrity has been organic and always on her own terms. For someone who never had an intention of being a professional musician, it\u2019s been a life of far-reaching changes and unexpected rewards.\nWebsite\n\nFAQs\nPLEASE CLICK HERE FOR A DETAILED FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

Then two years later, life took another turn skyward when Neil Young decided to make Promise of the Real his touring and studio band. Young has guided the grateful young musicians ever since as they\u2019ve backed the legend on tour around the world and on his two most recent albums.These experiences were undoubtedly invaluable, but none of what has come before will prepare you for the cosmic country soul of Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real, the band\u2019s new, self-titled album, a mesmerizing, emotionally genuine, endlessly rewarding work set for release on Fantasy Records. From the epic \u201cSet Me Down on a Cloud\u201d to the climactic \u201cIf I Started Over,\u201d the album delivers one sublime song and inspired performance after another.\u201cI knew I had a lot of good songs that transcended the cultural boundaries between rock & roll and country,\u201d Lukas says of his vision for the album. \u201cI wanted to get the songs as pure as they could be. We owe a lot to Neil; we made this record after coming off the road with him for two years. Neil\u2019s been mentoring us, and we\u2019ve been absorbing that energy, and I think it shows. We got acclimated to a different level of artistic expression. We\u2019ve grown.\u201dLukas Nelson & Promise of the Real, produced by song-shaping specialist John Alagia (numerous Dave Matthews Band LPs, John Mayer\u2019s Room for Squares) was recorded at The Village Studios in West Los Angeles. Promise of the Real\u2019s six-piece line-up now includes longtime bandmates Tato Melgar (percussion), Anthony LoGerfo (drums) and Corey McCormick (bass, vocals) along with new members Jesse Siebenberg (steel guitars, Farfisa organ, vocals) and Alberto Bof (piano, Wurlitzer, Hammond B3). Stefani \u201cLady Gaga\u201d Germanotta (who convincingly plays the role of Bonnie to Lukas\u2019 Delaney) added her signature vocals to the rousing \u201cCarolina\u201d and \u201cFind Yourself,\u201d while Jess Wolfe and Holly Lessig of the Brooklyn-based indie-pop duo Lucius provide backing vocals on five of the 12 tracks, evoking Exile on Main St.\u2019s ecstatic, gospel-rooted harmonies.The band\u2019s many influences can be discerned in the opening track, \u201cSet Me Down on a Cloud,\u201d a soulful country rocker that features Lucius\u2019 spiritual vocals and an extended solo underscores Lukas\u2019 tasteful guitar virtuosity.The lilting, pastoral \u201cJust Outside of Austin\u201d features a guitar solo from Willie, while Lukas\u2019 86-year-old Aunt Bobbi plays piano. \u201cIt\u2019s a love letter to Austin, something like Roger Miller or Glen Campbell would write,\u201d he said.\u201cRunnin\u2019 Shine,\u201d one of the album\u2019s first-person character studies, is written from the perspective of a young moonshiner trying to outsmart the law while hurtling along Appalachian back roads in a souped-up car loaded with homemade booze. \u201cPerspective is huge,\u201d says Lukas. \u201cIf you\u2019re able to put yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes and you can relate to them, it\u2019s really hard to hate them, even if you don\u2019t agree with how they live their life.\u201dTwo of the album\u2019s most breathtaking songs, \u201cFind Yourself\u201d and \u201cForget About Georgia,\u201d vividly retrace the turbulent final stages and bittersweet aftermath of the same doomed love affair. \u201cAfter the relationship ended, I had to play Ray Charles\u2019 \u201cGeorgia on My Mind\u201d every night when I was on the road with my dad, which made it literally impossible to forget about her.\u201d Introduced by a wistful four-note guitar lick that reoccurs throughout the arrangement, \u201cForget About Georgia\u201d unfolds to a \u201cLayla\u201d-like outpouring of romantic yearning, as the band stretches out behind Lukas\u2019 emotional guitar soloing. Not surprisingly, it\u2019s Young\u2019s favorite song on the album.\u00a0Inspired by the big ballads of Roy Orbison and Elvis Presley, Lukas delivers a full-throttle vocal on the closing track, \u201cIf I Started Over,\u201d at once a cosmic rumination and a rapturous expression of romantic devotion. \u201cThe song is asking, what if, after we die, we just come back? What if we have to do the same dream again until we learn the right lessons?\u00a0A seasoned veteran at 28, Austin-born Lukas grew up in Maui, while spending much of his time during school breaks in his hometown and on the road with his dad. \u201cI had a lot of passions growing up,\u201d he says. \u201cI played soccer, I was on the swim team, living a Maui lifestyle, surfing and skateboarding. I also loved singing and wrote my first song when I was 11. I became obsessed with guitar, playing eight to 10 hours a day. I knew what I wanted to do from a super-young age, and I made my life about it.\u201d He and his brother Micah played in bands together in high school, and they struck up a friendship with Uruguay-born Tato Melgar, a skilled musician then making his living as a landscaper, who taught the brothers the basics of drumming.In 2007, Lukas headed to the mainland to attend L.A.\u2019s Loyola Marymount University. A year later, after meeting LoGerfo at a Neil Young concert, he dropped out of school and started a band with LoGerfo, Melgar and original bassist Merlyn Kelly; he named it Promise of the Real, referencing a line in Young\u2019s 1973 song \u201cWalk On\u201d: \u201cSooner or later it all gets real.\u201d When McCormick joined two years later on bass, the POTR lineup was set. The band woodshedded; averaging more than 200 shows a year.\u00a0Drawing on Lukas\u2019 lineage as well surrogate uncles like Kris Kristofferson, Waylon Jennings, and the classic rock and roll of J.J. Cale, The Band, Clapton era Delaney and Bonnie and of course mentor Neil Young, they began to develop their own distinctive style of American music.Young befriended the band after checking them out at Farm Aid several years back. \u201cNeil got in touch after that, and we started talking by email,\u201d Lukas recounts. \u201cEventually, he asked us to record with him. So we recorded The Monsanto Years and played some shows together, and we fell in love with each other musically, one thing led to another and we became Neil\u2019s band.\u201cWhat\u2019s happened with us feels similar to the career trajectory of The Band,\u201d he continues. \u201cThey were already a great band when they started working with Dylan, who lifted them up, which is similar to what Neil\u2019s done for us. He\u2019s also given people a chance to hear what we\u2019re doing and what our own songs have to offer. Then we played the Desert Trip with Neil, along with Paul McCartney, the Stones, the Who and Dylan. That was incredible.\u201dThose two weekends in Indio last October turned out to be extremely fortuitous. \u201cWe met Lucius at Desert Trip,\u201d says Lukas. \u201cThey were playing with Roger Waters\u2014and still are. Then they came to the Bridge School Benefit, where we really got to know them. I love Jess and Holly\u2014they really enhance the record.\u201dBradley Cooper also saw Lukas play at Desert Trip, and right afterward contacted a mutual friend about helping him on the new film he\u2019s directing and starring in, a remake of A Star is Born. \u201cAt first I was just helping him out, and then I started writing with Stefani (Lady Gaga), who\u2019s in the movie. We connected and she and I became really close. I got very involved in this film and ended up bringing the band into it as well.\u201dComing of age in a celebrated musical family, Lukas Nelson learned early on that true originality is hard won, never given. Doubtlessly blessed with a measure of musical ability, it\u2019s clear that his natural gifts have been honed by a singular devotion to craft and a deep appreciation for the sacrifice a creative life requires. Elated by the way things have come together so beautifully, Lukas is gratified that POTR have earned this moment and seized the opportunities that have led to this album\u2014all perfectly capturing what he\u2019d heard in his head 18 months earlier.\u201cIt\u2019s just amazing how things have flowed,\u201d Lukas marvels. \u201cIt feels divine in a way.\u201d", "html": "<P><STRONG>LUKAS NELSON &amp; THE PROMISE OF THE REAL</STRONG></P><P><A HREF=\"https://www.facebook.com/lukasnelsonofficial\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Facebook</A>\u00a0|<A HREF=\"https://www.instagram.com/lukasnelsonofficial/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">\u00a0Instagram</A>\u00a0|\u00a0<A HREF=\"https://twitter.com/lukasnelson\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Twitter</A></P><P><STRONG>About the Show:</STRONG></P><P><EM>Doors 7:00pm / Show 8:00pm</EM></P><P><EM>Tickets on sale Friday, 4/26 at 10am</EM></P><P>Since forming 10 years ago, the buzz surrounding Lukas Nelson &amp; Promise of the Real has been quietly intensifying.\u00a0During that time, the 28-year old singer/songwriter/guitarist and his bandmates have played hundreds of shows and major festivals all over the world and built a devoted underground following.\u00a0Lukas\u2019 profile continued to rise when he contributed three songs and heavenly vocals to his dad Willie Nelson\u2019s 2012 album, Heroes, their voices blending with potent DNA. Then two years later, life took another turn skyward when Neil Young decided to make Promise of the Real his touring and studio band. Young has guided the grateful young musicians ever since as they\u2019ve backed the legend on tour around the world and on his two most recent albums.</P><P>These experiences were undoubtedly invaluable, but none of what has come before will prepare you for the cosmic country soul of Lukas Nelson &amp; Promise of the Real, the band\u2019s new, self-titled album, a mesmerizing, emotionally genuine, endlessly rewarding work set for release on Fantasy Records. From the epic \u201cSet Me Down on a Cloud\u201d to the climactic \u201cIf I Started Over,\u201d the album delivers one sublime song and inspired performance after another.</P><P>\u201cI knew I had a lot of good songs that transcended the cultural boundaries between rock &amp; roll and country,\u201d Lukas says of his vision for the album. \u201cI wanted to get the songs as pure as they could be. We owe a lot to Neil; we made this record after coming off the road with him for two years. Neil\u2019s been mentoring us, and we\u2019ve been absorbing that energy, and I think it shows. We got acclimated to a different level of artistic expression. We\u2019ve grown.\u201d</P><P>Lukas Nelson &amp; Promise of the Real, produced by song-shaping specialist John Alagia (numerous Dave Matthews Band LPs, John Mayer\u2019s Room for Squares) was recorded at The Village Studios in West Los Angeles. Promise of the Real\u2019s six-piece line-up now includes longtime bandmates Tato Melgar (percussion), Anthony LoGerfo (drums) and Corey McCormick (bass, vocals) along with new members Jesse Siebenberg (steel guitars, Farfisa organ, vocals) and Alberto Bof (piano, Wurlitzer, Hammond B3). Stefani \u201cLady Gaga\u201d Germanotta (who convincingly plays the role of Bonnie to Lukas\u2019 Delaney) added her signature vocals to the rousing \u201cCarolina\u201d and \u201cFind Yourself,\u201d while Jess Wolfe and Holly Lessig of the Brooklyn-based indie-pop duo Lucius provide backing vocals on five of the 12 tracks, evoking Exile on Main St.\u2019s ecstatic, gospel-rooted harmonies.</P><P>The band\u2019s many influences can be discerned in the opening track, \u201cSet Me Down on a Cloud,\u201d a soulful country rocker that features Lucius\u2019 spiritual vocals and an extended solo underscores Lukas\u2019 tasteful guitar virtuosity.</P><P>The lilting, pastoral \u201cJust Outside of Austin\u201d features a guitar solo from Willie, while Lukas\u2019 86-year-old Aunt Bobbi plays piano. \u201cIt\u2019s a love letter to Austin, something like Roger Miller or Glen Campbell would write,\u201d he said.</P><P>\u201cRunnin\u2019 Shine,\u201d one of the album\u2019s first-person character studies, is written from the perspective of a young moonshiner trying to outsmart the law while hurtling along Appalachian back roads in a souped-up car loaded with homemade booze. \u201cPerspective is huge,\u201d says Lukas. \u201cIf you\u2019re able to put yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes and you can relate to them, it\u2019s really hard to hate them, even if you don\u2019t agree with how they live their life.\u201d</P><P>Two of the album\u2019s most breathtaking songs, \u201cFind Yourself\u201d and \u201cForget About Georgia,\u201d vividly retrace the turbulent final stages and bittersweet aftermath of the same doomed love affair. \u201cAfter the relationship ended, I had to play Ray Charles\u2019 \u201cGeorgia on My Mind\u201d every night when I was on the road with my dad, which made it literally impossible to forget about her.\u201d Introduced by a wistful four-note guitar lick that reoccurs throughout the arrangement, \u201cForget About Georgia\u201d unfolds to a \u201cLayla\u201d-like outpouring of romantic yearning, as the band stretches out behind Lukas\u2019 emotional guitar soloing. Not surprisingly, it\u2019s Young\u2019s favorite song on the album.\u00a0</P><P>Inspired by the big ballads of Roy Orbison and Elvis Presley, Lukas delivers a full-throttle vocal on the closing track, \u201cIf I Started Over,\u201d at once a cosmic rumination and a rapturous expression of romantic devotion. \u201cThe song is asking, what if, after we die, we just come back? What if we have to do the same dream again until we learn the right lessons?\u00a0</P><P>A seasoned veteran at 28, Austin-born Lukas grew up in Maui, while spending much of his time during school breaks in his hometown and on the road with his dad. \u201cI had a lot of passions growing up,\u201d he says. \u201cI played soccer, I was on the swim team, living a Maui lifestyle, surfing and skateboarding. I also loved singing and wrote my first song when I was 11. I became obsessed with guitar, playing eight to 10 hours a day. I knew what I wanted to do from a super-young age, and I made my life about it.\u201d He and his brother Micah played in bands together in high school, and they struck up a friendship with Uruguay-born Tato Melgar, a skilled musician then making his living as a landscaper, who taught the brothers the basics of drumming.</P><P>In 2007, Lukas headed to the mainland to attend L.A.\u2019s Loyola Marymount University. A year later, after meeting LoGerfo at a Neil Young concert, he dropped out of school and started a band with LoGerfo, Melgar and original bassist Merlyn Kelly; he named it Promise of the Real, referencing a line in Young\u2019s 1973 song \u201cWalk On\u201d: \u201cSooner or later it all gets real.\u201d When McCormick joined two years later on bass, the POTR lineup was set. The band woodshedded; averaging more than 200 shows a year.\u00a0Drawing on Lukas\u2019 lineage as well surrogate uncles like Kris Kristofferson, Waylon Jennings, and the classic rock and roll of J.J. Cale, The Band, Clapton era Delaney and Bonnie and of course mentor Neil Young, they began to develop their own distinctive style of American music.</P><P>Young befriended the band after checking them out at Farm Aid several years back. \u201cNeil got in touch after that, and we started talking by email,\u201d Lukas recounts. \u201cEventually, he asked us to record with him. So we recorded The Monsanto Years and played some shows together, and we fell in love with each other musically, one thing led to another and we became Neil\u2019s band.</P><P>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened with us feels similar to the career trajectory of The Band,\u201d he continues. \u201cThey were already a great band when they started working with Dylan, who lifted them up, which is similar to what Neil\u2019s done for us.

Back in 2001, the sextet mostly played in underground night clubs around Manhattan, but there were various festival appearances throughout the country.\n\nAll the members of the band had composed music specifically for the ensemble, but unfortunately, they did not record, until now. Fast forward to the present day, there was the decision to reestablish and expand the band to include percussionist - Rogerio Boccato and to finally record the original compositions and the music of one of our heroes, the great vibraphonist, marimbist and composer, Bobby Hutcherson.\n\nLife Cycles had hoped to record with Bobby Hutcherson, but sadly, he passed away in August of 2016. As a result of this loss to the world, the band felt that no more time should be taken for granted and decided to honor Bobby\u2019s memory by recording several compositions he wrote and recorded, along with the entirety of the album, NOW! , recorded in 1969 and released in 1970.\n\nLife Cycles (Volume 1) Personnel: Brian Blade - drums Rogerio Boccato - percussion Jon Cowherd - piano Monte Croft - vibraphone / vocals John Hart - guitar Myron Walden - saxophone Doug Weiss - bass\nFacebook\n\nFAQs\nPLEASE CLICK HERE FOR A DETAILED FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

And music listens best when you pour your heart out.\"Oh Land also composes music for film, theater and the classical music world. She has performed with Lang Lang and Joshua Bell at Carnegie Hall in New York City, and orchestrated concerts for the Danish Symphony orchestra in her native country of Denmark. She collaborated with the Queen of Denmark to create a ballet for the Danish Theatre (2016); created the music for Watermusic, a multimedia performance for over 15,000 people at Randers Harbor combining architecture, dance and music (2017), as well as creating the musical score for the exhibition \"The Ship\" at Nikolaj Kunsthal in collaboration with Eske Kath.

For many years, that\u2019s how 2018 Americana Award nominee Daniel Donato operated as the guitarist for Nashville acts like The Wild Feathers, Paul Cauthen and The Don Kelley Band.\nFrom age 14, Donato has developed his brand of crisp, soulful, on-the-edge telecaster picking under bar lights, honing his skills and proving his mettle within the city\u2019s prominent live music scene. All the while, a growing love of songwriting mirrored the pace of his ever-improving guitar chops.\nNow, a short three years after his departure from Kelley\u2019s classic country outfit, the 23-year-old is signed to WME as an artist with a docket of jam-ready country and bluegrass songs. Backed by his three-piece \u201cCosmic Country Band\u201d \u2013 cosmic country is a catch-all term for experimental roots music, often assisted by electronic sounds \u2013 Donato stands at the frontier of his career with characteristic intrepidity, no longer bounded by the expressive limitations of his instrument.\nHis strident voice and explorative songwriting carry his music into new territory, offering bold ideas to his fan base while staying true to what drew them to him in the first place: a palpable love of music delivered through excelled craft. With one eye on the night\u2019s gig and another on the ages, Donato is continuing his journey down country music\u2019s long and winding road, leaving no stone unturned.\nWebsite\n\nFAQs\nPlease click here for a detailed FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

Backed by his three-piece \u201cCosmic Country Band\u201d \u2013 cosmic country is a catch-all term for experimental roots music, often assisted by electronic sounds \u2013 Donato stands at the frontier of his career with characteristic intrepidity, no longer bounded by the expressive limitations of his instrument.</P>\n<P>His strident voice and explorative songwriting carry his music into new territory, offering bold ideas to his fan base while staying true to what drew them to him in the first place: a palpable love of music delivered through excelled craft. With one eye on the night\u2019s gig and another on the ages, Donato is continuing his journey down country music\u2019s long and winding road, leaving no stone unturned.<BR></P>\n<P><A HREF=\"https://danieldonato.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><SPAN>Website</SPAN></A></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<H2><STRONG>FAQs</STRONG></H2>\n<P><STRONG>Please click <A HREF=\"http://evanstonspace.com/faq\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</A> for a detailed FAQ.</STRONG></P>\n<P><STRONG>Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0</STRONG>Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

This concert was released as a live album in 2013, and the version of \"Yesterday Was Hard On All Of Us\" from the record was used by Ava DuVernay in her Oscar nominated film Selma. In the same year, Justin Vernon &amp; Colin Stetson teamed together to remix \u201cWarm Shadow,\u201d which was later prominently featured in AMC\u2019s The Walking Dead.<BR></P>\n<P>The studio album Hard Believer released in 2014, courtesy of Fink\u2019s Ninja Tune sub-label R\u2019COUP\u2019D, included the hit \"Looking Too Closely\" which has over 30 licenses to TV and Film, and over 45 million plays on Spotify. 2017 marked the beginning of his collaboration with Flood (Nick Cave, PJ Harvey, Warpaint, U2) as a producer and mentor, culminating in the release of both his Blues side project Fink\u2019s Sunday Night Blues Club, Vol.1. Colin Stetson once again collaborated with Fink on \u201cShe Was Right\u201d, a stand out track from the collection. Resurgam, the most recent full length album by Fink, was recorded and produced by Flood in his Assault &amp; Battery studios in London.</P>\n<P>Fink makes his way back to North America this fall for an intimate &amp; special solo acoustic tour - a highly anticipated coast to coast return.<BR></P>\n<P><A HREF=\"http://www.finkworld.co.uk/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Website</A></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<H2><STRONG>FAQs</STRONG></H2>\n<P><EM><STRONG>PLEASE CLICK\u00a0<A HREF=\"http://evanstonspace.com/about/faq/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">HERE</A>\u00a0FOR A MORE DETAILED FAQ.\u00a0</STRONG></EM></P>\n<P><STRONG>Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0</STRONG>Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

cultural history of exploring in-between places. Through her latest,\u00a0Titanic Rising\u00a0(out April 5, 2019 on Sub Pop Records), Weyes Blood (a.k.a. Natalie Mering) has, too, designed her own universe to soulfully navigate life\u2019s mysteries. Maneuvering through a space-time continuum, she intriguingly plays the role of melodic, sometimes melancholic, anthropologist.Tellingly, Mering classifies\u00a0Titanic Rising\u00a0as the Kinks meet WWII or Bob Seger meets Enya. The latter captures the album\u2019s willful expansiveness (\u201cYou can tell there\u2019s not a guy pulling the strings in Enya\u2019s studio,\u201d she notes, admiringly). The former relays her imperative to connect with listeners. \u201cThe clarity of Bob Seger is unmistakable. I\u2019m a big fan of conversational songwriting,\u201d she adds. \u201cI just try to do that in a way that uses abstract imagery as well.\u201d\u201cAn album is like a Rubik\u2019s Cube,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes you get all the dimensions -- the lyrics, the melody, the production -- to line up. I try to be futuristic and ancient at once, which is a difficult alchemy. It\u2019s taken a lot of different tries to get it right.\u201d As concept-album as it may sound, it\u2019s also a devoted exercise in realism, albeit occasionally magical. Here, the throwback-cinema grandeur of \u201cA Lot\u2019s Gonna Change\u201d gracefully coexists with the otherworldly title track, an ominous instrumental.\u00a0Titanic Rising, written and recorded during the first half of 2018, is the culmination of three albums and years of touring: stronger chops and ballsier decisions. It\u2019s an achievement in transcendent vocals and levitating arrangements -- one she could reach only by flying under the radar for so many years. \u201cI used to want to belong,\u201d says the L.A. based musician. \u201cI realized I had to forge my own path. Nobody was going to do that for me. That was liberating. I became a Joan of Arc solo musician.\u201dThe Weyes Blood frontwoman grew up singing in gospel and madrigal choirs. \u201cClassical and Renaissance music really influenced me,\u201d says Mering, who first picked up a guitar at age 8. (Listen closely to\u00a0Titanic Rising, and you\u2019ll also hear the jazz of Hoagy Carmichael mingle with the artful mysticism of Alejandro Jodorowsky and the monomyth of scholar Joseph Campbell.) \u201cSomething to Believe,\u201d a confessional that makes judicious use of the slide guitar, touches on that cosmological upbringing. \u201cBelief is something all humans need. Shared myths are part of our psychology and survival,\u201d she says. \u201cNow we have a weird mishmash of capitalism and movies and science. There have been moments where I felt very existential and lost.\u201dAs a kid, she filled that void with\u00a0Titanic.\u00a0(Yes, the movie.) \u201cIt was engineered for little girls and had its own mythology,\u201d she explains. Mering also noticed that the blockbuster romance actually offered a story about loss born of man\u2019s hubris. \u201cIt\u2019s so symbolic that the Titanic would crash into an iceberg, and now that iceberg is melting, sinking civilization.\u201d Today, this hubris also extends to the relentless adoption of technology, at the expense of both happiness and attention spans.The track \u201cMovies\u201d marks another Titanic-related epiphany, \u201cthat movies had been brainwashing people and their ideas about romantic love.\u201d To that end, Mering has become an expert at deconstructing intimacy. Sweeping and string-laden, \u201cAndromeda\u201d seems engineered to fibrillate hearts. \u201cIt\u2019s about losing your interest in trying to be in love,\u201d she says. \u201cEverybody is their own galaxy, their own separate entity. There is a feeling of needing to be saved, and that\u2019s a lot to ask of people.\u201d Its companion track, \u201cEveryday,\u201d \u201cis about the chaos of modern dating,\u201d she says, \u201cthe idea of sailing off onto your ships to nowhere to deal with all your baggage.\u201dBut Weyes Blood isn\u2019t one to stew. Her observations play out in an ethereal saunter: far more meditative than cynical. \u201cI experience reality on a slower, more hypnotic level,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a more contemplative kind of writer.\u201d To Mering, listening and thinking are concurrent experiences. \u201cThere are complicated influences mixed in with more relatable nostalgic melodies,\u201d she says. \u201cIn my mind my music feels so big, a true production. I\u2019m not a huge, popular artist, but I feel like one when I\u2019m in the studio. But it\u2019s never taking away from the music.

There is a feeling of needing to be saved, and that\u2019s a lot to ask of people.\u201d Its companion track, \u201cEveryday,\u201d \u201cis about the chaos of modern dating,\u201d she says, \u201cthe idea of sailing off onto your ships to nowhere to deal with all your baggage.\u201d</P><P>But Weyes Blood isn\u2019t one to stew. Her observations play out in an ethereal saunter: far more meditative than cynical. \u201cI experience reality on a slower, more hypnotic level,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a more contemplative kind of writer.\u201d To Mering, listening and thinking are concurrent experiences. \u201cThere are complicated influences mixed in with more relatable nostalgic melodies,\u201d she says. \u201cIn my mind my music feels so big, a true production. I\u2019m not a huge, popular artist, but I feel like one when I\u2019m in the studio. But it\u2019s never taking away from the music. I\u2019m just making a bigger space for myself.\u201d</P>"}, "id": "62061471532", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/weyes-blood-thalia-hall-tickets-62061471532?aff=ebapi", "start": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2019-09-30T19:30:00", "utc": "2019-10-01T00:30:00Z"}, "end": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2019-10-01T06:00:00", "utc": "2019-10-01T11:00:00Z"}, "organization_id": "224181606708", "created": "2019-05-17T18:02:37Z", "changed": "2019-05-31T03:48:35Z", "published": "2019-05-20T14:00:08Z", "capacity": null, "capacity_is_custom": null, "status": "live", "currency": "USD", "listed": true, "shareable": false, "online_event": false, "tx_time_limit": 480, "hide_start_date": false, "hide_end_date": true, "locale": "en_US", "is_locked": false, "privacy_setting": "unlocked", "is_series": false, "is_series_parent": false, "inventory_type": "limited", "is_reserved_seating": false, "show_pick_a_seat": false, "show_seatmap_thumbnail": false, "show_colors_in_seatmap_thumbnail": false, "source": "queue", "is_free": false, "version": "4.0.0", "summary": "WEYES BLOODFacebook\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter\u00a0|\u00a0WebsiteAbout the Show:Doors 7:30pm / Show 8:30pmTickets on sale Friday 5/24 at 10amThe phantom zone, the par", "logo_id": "62481744", "organizer_id": "14941061407", "venue_id": "20880651", "category_id": "103", "subcategory_id": null, "format_id": null, "resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/events/62061471532/", "is_externally_ticketed": false, "music_properties": {"resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/events/62061471532/music_properties/", "age_restriction": "17+", "presented_by": null, "door_time": null}, "ticket_availability": {"has_available_tickets": true, "minimum_ticket_price": {"currency": "USD", "value": 2000, "major_value": "20.00", "display": "20.00 USD"}, "maximum_ticket_price": {"currency": "USD", "value": 3500, "major_value": "35.00", "display": "35.00 USD"}, "is_sold_out": false, "start_sales_date": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2019-05-24T10:00:00", "utc": "2019-05-24T15:00:00Z"}, "waitlist_available": false}, "format": null, "venue": {"address": {"address_1": "1807 South Allport Street", "address_2": null, "city": "Chicago", "region": "IL", "postal_code": "60608", "country": "US", "latitude": "41.8577", "longitude": "-87.6572", "localized_address_display": "1807 South Allport Street, Chicago, IL 60608", "localized_area_display": "Chicago, IL", "localized_multi_line_address_display": ["1807 South Allport Street", "Chicago, IL 60608"]}, "resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/venues/20880651/", "id": "20880651", "age_restriction": null, "capacity": null, "name": "Thalia Hall", "latitude": "41.8577", "longitude": "-87.6572"}, "basic_inventory_info": {"has_ticket_classes": true, "has_inventory_tiers": false, "has_ticket_rules": false, "has_add_ons": false, "has_donations": false}, "bookmark_info": {"bookmarked": false}, "logo": {"crop_mask": {"top_left": {"x": 0, "y": 0}, "width": 1431, "height": 715}, "original": {"url": "https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F62481744%2F224181606708%2F1%2Foriginal.20190517-180249?auto=compress&s=b566d57e70487efb30781e4b02bae5fb", "width": 1431, "height": 959}, "id": "62481744", "url": "https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F62481744%2F224181606708%2F1%2Foriginal.20190517-180249?h=200&w=450&auto=compress&rect=0%2C0%2C1431%2C715&s=d910b992c0c7e751e45a03aa0aa16408", "aspect_ratio": "2.001398601398601398601398601", "edge_color": null, "edge_color_set": true}}, {"name": {"text": "Tinariwen with Lonnie Holley @ Thalia Hall", "html": "Tinariwen with Lonnie Holley @ Thalia Hall"}, "description": {"text": "TINARIWENFacebook\u00a0I\u00a0Instagram\u00a0I\u00a0TwitterAbout The ShowDoors: 7:30pm / Show: 8:30pmTickets on sale Friday 4/5 at 11amThe new album by Tinariwen could well have been called Exile on Main Street.\u00a0But other people have already thought of that. It also could have been called A la recherch\u00e9 du pays perdu (\u2018Remembrance of a lost country\u2019). Except that would have been a tad Proustian for musicians who grew up pretty much between a rock and a sand dune, in the midst of their goat herds and camel caravans. But the idea is apt. As is the painful paradox, if you consider that while Tinariwen were busy criss-crossing the globe on their recent triumphant tours (160 concerts played in the past three years), expanding their audience on all five continents, becoming one of the latest musical phenomena of truly universal calibre, the frontiers that encircle their desert home were closing down and double-locking, forcing them into exile to record this their 8th album.Over the past five years, their beloved homeland in the Adrar des Ifoghas, a Saharan mountain range that straddles the border between north-eastern Mali and southern Algeria has, in effect, been transformed into a conflict zone, a place where nobody can venture without putting themselves in danger and where war lords devoted either to jihad or trafficking (sometimes both at the same time), have put any activity that contradicts their beliefs or escapes their control in jeopardy. Even though the 12 songs on this new record evoke those cherished deserts of home, they were recorded a long way away from them. And, as a result of this separation, at a time when the political, military and humanitarian situation in the region has never been so critical, the feelings and the emotions that the band managed to capture on record have never been so vivid.\u00a0In October 2014, making use of a few days off in the middle of a long American tour, the band stopped off at Rancho de la Luna studios in California\u2019s Joshua Tree National Park. The place has become the favoured refuge of the stoner rock tribe. Josh Homme and his Queens of the Stone Age were the first to make it their hive, and since then, whether in use by P J Harvey or the Foo Fighters, Iggy Pop or the Arctic Monkeys, neither the mixing console nor the kitchen ovens have had a moment to cool down. For Tinariwen, the geographical location of the studios \u2013 lost in the middle of that horizontal desert, that mineral immensity, where Man is reminded of his own insignificance in ways that can only, in the end, either kill him or sublimate him \u2013 proved to be particularly propitious in terms of creativity.And the human climate was just as favourable. As session followed session, musicians who know the place well dropped by to add their own touch to that pre-industrial boogie which comes from a world where only the essential and metaphysical passions of space and time have any meaning. Such was the case of Matt Sweeny, guitarist of fine pedigree (Johnny Cash, Bonnie Prince Billy and Cat Power) and an avowed fan of the band. Kurt Vile, ex-member of the duo War On Drugs, now spearheading a noisy indi-folk combo, also took part in the debate. As did Alan Johannes, multi-instrumentalist, sound engineer and producer of the first few albums by Queens of the Stone Age, a band with whom Mark Lanegan, the other guest on the album, has also been a singer. From their angle, one might have expected all these contributions to result in something pretty heavy, with those American guitars coming into to reinforce the ishumar (name of the musical style of which Tinariwen precursors) guitars of Ibrahim, Abdallah Hassan and Elaga. In effect, lovers of those sensual yet abrasive riffs that are the band\u2019s signature won\u2019t be disappointed. But neither will those who love the funky, danceable side of Tinariwen, which comes through loud and clear courtesy of bassist Eyadou and percussionist Sarid, a veritable rhythm machine in the mould of Sly and Robbie. All that potential has been wonderfully honed by the album\u2019s mixing engineer Andrew Schepps, who has previously worked with the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Johny Cash, and Jay Z.That happy encounter between Tamasheks and rockers was already in evidence back in 2011, with the involvement of Wilco and TV On The Radio on the album Tassili, which was recorded in the depths of the Sahara. It was as if those musicians, coming from their world of high tech, leisure and entertainment, sought to reinvigorate the way they do things by working with artists who have been forced by necessity to reduce everything to its essence, and who bear a different destiny. In that sense, Ibrahim and his tribe restore meaning to an activity which has been partially drained all existential significance. In a cultural environment that has been overtaken by the petty and the superficial, the members of Tinariwen fascinate because they incarnate a salutary break and come across as the ultimate heroes in the midst of an army of fleshless puppets.Having said that, in M\u2019Hamid El Ghizlane they\u2019re heroes for real, so much so that the youth of the area know how to sing their songs in the same way that people in other parts of the world know how to sing the Stones or Led Zep . It was there, in that oasis in southern Morocco, close by the Algerian frontier, that the band set up their tents for three weeks in March 2016 to record this 8th album, accompanied now and then by the local musical youth in question, or by a local Ganga outfit (a group of Berber \u2018gnawa\u2019 trance musicians). The album is called Elwan (\u2018The Elephants\u2019), not Exile On Main Street, though it fits nicely into that \u2018road record\u2019 category nonetheless.There are road records just like there are road movies. In American cinema, a road movie always unfolds the same way. Characters travel from one place to another in search of some truth, of a future might offer them some kind of revelation. But they always end up reconnecting with their own past, their origins. Of course, it\u2019s an impossible return, because that past, those founding origins have been irrevocably erased. It\u2019s the same for this record, so musically powerful and yet poignant in human terms: every song evokes a land that can no longer be found, a lost world, with all that this implies in terms of emotional range, from nostalgia for a joyous past to the tragic recent loss of a territory, and of the dream that it nourished. The emotional \u2018bite\u2019 of that loss imbues some of the songs by Ibrahim, such as Imidiwan n-akal-in (Friends from my country), Hayati (My life) or T\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 Takhal (What\u2019s Happened to the Desert). It\u2019s in that last song that the famous elephants of the album title make their appearance, an animal metaphor to describe those \u2018beasts\u2019, whether militias or multinational consortiums, who have trampled everything in their path: kindness, respect, solidarity, ancestral traditions and the values essential to life in the desert, where both the human and ecological equilibriums are extremely fragile.But the songs written by Abdallah, such as Sastanaqqam (I Question You), or those penned by Hassan, the deeply disturbing Ittus (Our Goal), also evoke a similar sense of helplessness and disempowerment. The same goes for Nannuflay (Fulfilled), written by Eyadou, one of the \u2018kids\u2019 in the band; it\u2019s a song echoes that sense of absolute crisis. Having said that, between the weariness of the old fighters of the Touareg rebellion of the 1990s (Ibrahim, Hassan, Abdallah) and the dynamism of a youth that\u2019s still emerging (Eyadou, Elaga, Sarid, Sadam), you get a wonderfully symbiotic mix. The meeting of two such disparate generations in one band is relatively rare in today\u2019s musical world. In Tinariwen, it\u2019s a meeting that celebrates, even more powerfully might otherwise be the case, the capacity of music to make experiences as intense and cruel as exile beautiful and, in some ways, even attractive, experiences that would surely end up destroying those who lived them, if this form of aesthetic relief didn\u2019t exist.Francis DordoTranslated by Andy Morgan", "html": "<P><STRONG>TINARIWEN</STRONG></P><P><A HREF=\"https://www.facebook.com/tinariwenmusic/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Facebook</A>\u00a0I<A HREF=\"https://www.instagram.com/tinariwen/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">\u00a0Instagram</A>\u00a0I\u00a0<A HREF=\"https://twitter.com/tinariwen\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Twitter</A></P><P><STRONG>About The Show</STRONG></P><P><EM>Doors: 7:30pm / Show: 8:30pm</EM></P><P><EM>Tickets on sale Friday 4/5 at 11am</EM></P><P>The new album by Tinariwen could well have been called Exile on Main Street.\u00a0But other people have already thought of that.

In Tinariwen, it\u2019s a meeting that celebrates, even more powerfully might otherwise be the case, the capacity of music to make experiences as intense and cruel as exile beautiful and, in some ways, even attractive, experiences that would surely end up destroying those who lived them, if this form of aesthetic relief didn\u2019t exist.</P><P>Francis Dordo</P><P>Translated by Andy Morgan</P>"}, "id": "59612950941", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tinariwen-with-lonnie-holley-thalia-hall-tickets-59612950941?aff=ebapi", "start": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2019-10-01T19:30:00", "utc": "2019-10-02T00:30:00Z"}, "end": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2019-10-02T06:00:00", "utc": "2019-10-02T11:00:00Z"}, "organization_id": "224181606708", "created": "2019-03-29T20:55:51Z", "changed": "2019-05-31T05:16:25Z", "published": "2019-04-03T16:01:06Z", "capacity": null, "capacity_is_custom": null, "status": "live", "currency": "USD", "listed": true, "shareable": false, "online_event": false, "tx_time_limit": 480, "hide_start_date": false, "hide_end_date": true, "locale": "en_US", "is_locked": false, "privacy_setting": "unlocked", "is_series": false, "is_series_parent": false, "inventory_type": "limited", "is_reserved_seating": false, "show_pick_a_seat": false, "show_seatmap_thumbnail": false, "show_colors_in_seatmap_thumbnail": false, "source": "queue", "is_free": false, "version": "4.0.0", "summary": "TINARIWENFacebook\u00a0I\u00a0Instagram\u00a0I\u00a0TwitterAbout The ShowDoors: 7:30pm / Show: 8:30pmTickets on sale Friday 4/5 at 11amThe new album by Tinariwe", "logo_id": "59376865", "organizer_id": "14941061407", "venue_id": "20880651", "category_id": "103", "subcategory_id": null, "format_id": null, "resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/events/59612950941/", "is_externally_ticketed": false, "music_properties": {"resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/events/59612950941/music_properties/", "age_restriction": "17+", "presented_by": null, "door_time": null}, "ticket_availability": {"has_available_tickets": true, "minimum_ticket_price": {"currency": "USD", "value": 2800, "major_value": "28.00", "display": "28.00 USD"}, "maximum_ticket_price": {"currency": "USD", "value": 4500, "major_value": "45.00", "display": "45.00 USD"}, "is_sold_out": false, "start_sales_date": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2019-04-05T11:00:00", "utc": "2019-04-05T16:00:00Z"}, "waitlist_available": false}, "format": null, "venue": {"address": {"address_1": "1807 South Allport Street", "address_2": null, "city": "Chicago", "region": "IL", "postal_code": "60608", "country": "US", "latitude": "41.8577", "longitude": "-87.6572", "localized_address_display": "1807 South Allport Street, Chicago, IL 60608", "localized_area_display": "Chicago, IL", "localized_multi_line_address_display": ["1807 South Allport Street", "Chicago, IL 60608"]}, "resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/venues/20880651/", "id": "20880651", "age_restriction": null, "capacity": null, "name": "Thalia Hall", "latitude": "41.8577", "longitude": "-87.6572"}, "basic_inventory_info": {"has_ticket_classes": true, "has_inventory_tiers": false, "has_ticket_rules": false, "has_add_ons": false, "has_donations": false}, "bookmark_info": {"bookmarked": false}, "logo": {"crop_mask": {"top_left": {"x": 0, "y": 0}, "width": 1250, "height": 625}, "original": {"url": "https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F59376865%2F224181606708%2F1%2Foriginal.20190329-205717?auto=compress&s=5b578901570495c178f52a221ce90282", "width": 1250, "height": 836}, "id": "59376865", "url": "https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F59376865%2F224181606708%2F1%2Foriginal.20190329-205717?h=200&w=450&auto=compress&rect=0%2C0%2C1250%2C625&s=aa6ced17bfcfcc5f080e1c558809d14a", "aspect_ratio": "2", "edge_color": null, "edge_color_set": true}}, {"name": {"text": "Griffin House", "html": "Griffin House"}, "description": {"text": "DOORS: 7pm \u00a0| \u00a0SHOW: 8pm\nTo see a detailed seat map, please choose \"Tickets\" in the upper righthand corner, select your ticket choices & click \"view on map.\"\u00a0\nTICKETS GO ON-SALE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC FRI, APR 19, AT 10AM CT.\nABOUT THE ARTIST\nIt is a true, and nowadays rare, musician who writes lyrics so vulnerable and authentic that an audience is irrevocably captured by the powerful experience of sharing the journey. An album that is essentially an autobiographical account of personal mistakes, change, and growth, offers listeners a chance to reflect on their own experiences and connect with another\u2019s story.\nWith Griffin House\u2019s upcoming album, So On And So Forth, it is clear the artist digs deep and offers up his narrative after much reflection. House is now a young family man and artist who is choosing sobriety and celebrating the path to his success, through songs which share his perspective on how people remember the past with rose-colored glasses, how we grow up and realize what we deeply need, and how we must find happiness in ourselves in the present.\n\u201cThe record has a lot to do with recognizing the ego in one\u2019s self and letting it die. It can feel like your whole identity is being wiped away, and you don\u2019t even know who you are anymore. For the person singing these songs, holding on to one\u2019s own individuality in order to remain special or important in the world has started to became far less important than being content with being a good, decent, and loving person. But old habits die hard,\u201d adds House.\nThe project was tracked last summer at Lakehouse Recording Studios, in Asbury Park, New Jersey. House\u2019s ties to Asbury Park go all the back to 2004, when he was invited to tour with Patti Scialfa. His first show in the boardwalk town was opening a show for Scialfa at the Paramount Theatre. It was there that Griffin met her husband, Bruce Springsteen, and all the wonderful characters in their crew and band. Those memories and experiences made returning to Asbury Park over a decade later to record So On And So Forth feel like a full circle moment in his career.\nHouse recorded the essentially live project with no click track and very little overdubbing. Lakehouse owner, Jon Leidersdorff, helped assemble the band. Prior to walking into the studio, House had never met the musicians and had no idea how the songs would turn out. He adds, \u201cThe experience ended up being one of the most fun and positive of my career. The process was stress-free and freeing.\u201d The resulting album reflects this journey -- a leap of faith with triumphant results.\nRecording and performing for over a decade, House has toured with Ron Sexsmith, Patti Scialfa, Josh Ritter, John Mellencamp, Mat Kearney, and The Cranberries. He received early critical acclaim on the CBS Sunday Morning, and his songs have since been featured in countless films and television shows such as One Tree Hill, Army Wives, and Brothers and Sisters. He has also appeared on Late Night with Craig Ferguson. Most recently, CNN Newsroom invited House to perform \u201cParis Calling,\u201d from So On and So Forth, live on the air, and the song has been picked up by radio prior to being serviced. House has released ten albums and continues to headline his own national tours. He lives in Nashville, Tennessee with his wife Jane and their two daughters.\nWebsite\n\nFAQs\nPLEASE CLICK HERE FOR A DETAILED FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

He started playing harmonica in 2000, taking lessons from renowned teacher, Joe Filisko at the Old Town School of Folk Music. He played with The Shakes and Tongue & Groove before starting The Special 20s in 2005. Their first, self-titled release, recorded in 2006, was received with great reviews, taking the 20s from playing one or two nights a month to constant bookings all over the city.

In the eight years since they formed, what\u2019s followed is an impressive reach of their music, with steady international touring, nearly\u00a047 million combined YouTube views\u00a0and over\u00a0260 million streams on Spotify.On the Corner Where You Live\u00a0wafts evocatively with noir-ish saxophones, guitars, ambient traffic, even the languid sound of rain.

Like two sides of a coin, it\u2019s the same feeling, just different expressions of them\u201d.The Paper Kites co-produced\u00a0On the Corner Where You Live\u00a0with Grammy-winner\u00a0Peter Katis\u00a0at his studio in Connecticut \u2013 a 120 year old victorian era home that the band lived and recorded in for 5 weeks.On the Corner Where You Live\u2019s opening instrumental \u201cA\u00a0Gathering on 57th\u201d bridges the gap between the two records, the first thing you hear is the sound of the train running along the tracks and a street busker wailing into the night. The albums\u2019 concept came to Sam while on tour -\u00a0\u201cIt came from watching people really, being in unfamiliar cities, observing other people's lives. I remember the band was staying in a hotel on 57th\u00a0street in Manhattan and we'd come home from wherever we'd been. Our hotel window in New York City looked straight into the apartment building across the street. You could see all these windows lighting up and people getting home from their nights out. We just sat there and watched them. It was fascinating. It was living art.\u201d\u201cGive Me Your Fire, Give Me Your Rain\u201d\u00a0takes over from where On The Train Ride Home left off. Josh Bentley's punching drums making a statement that the record is a slightly different affair from the quiet solitude of the previous offering. A lush sonic tidal wave of midnight melancholy sets the tone of longing, loss and hope echoed through everything that follows.The band recorded the Manhattan street noise from the window of their 57th\u00a0street hotel, adding it to the lilting meditation \u201cMidtown Waitress,\u201d Sam tells the story of being alone in London bar years ago, where an elderly woman who turned out to be a pianist for the ballet scribbled down a melody on a piece of paper, gifting it to him, naming it \u201cThe Encounter.\u201d During the recording session, Sam dug out that piece of paper, transforming it into a woozy, sax-based coda to \u201cMidtown Waitress.\u201d\u201cMusic is so much more purposeful and devastating when it makes you feel exposed,\u201d says Sam. Take \u201cDeep Burn Blue,\u201d a song about a girl who won\u2019t leave her room. \u201cIt\u2019s that feeling of being so inside your own thoughts that it\u2019s debilitating.\u201d (If that weren\u2019t gutting enough, the song even references Nick Drake with the line, \u201cYou like the sound of a pink moon cry/Lying on the floor as the day goes by.\u201d) Its foil is \u201cWhen It Hurts You,\u201d a harmonic lament about a man, locked-out of his apartment, making phone calls and yelling apologies from the street below. Says Sam; \u201cYou\u2019re hoping the next morning things will smooth over, but you know it probably won't.\u201dSam wrote 30 songs across three months. \u201cIt certainly consumed me. I was exhausted by the end of it,\u201d he says,\u00a0\u201cI didn't stop writing until Christina told me I had to stop.\u201dChristina Lacy takes lead vocals on \u201cMess We Made\u201d, her first lead song since the bands debut album. Sam says\u00a0\u201cI remember we had planned to have her singing lead vocals on the last record (twelvefour) \u2013 but our producer at the time felt it sounded as if she was just singing my songs and wasn't making them her own \u2013 so we decided that if she was singing on a record it had to be songs that she'd written and had an emotional connection to, and she did just that.\u201dAuthenticity is important to Sam, who penned many of the lyrics for both albums while on the road,\u00a0composing both albums in Melbourne. Amongst his many influences \u2013 film played a part. \u201cI had films playing on the wall of my studio: \u2018Lost In Translation,\u2019 \u2018Rear Window,\u2019 \u2018Lost Highway\u2019,\u201d he explains. In that vein, he wrote the piano-based track \u201cDoes It Ever Cross Your Mind\u201d while working at a cinema.Immersed in an aural diet of blues and jazz, \u201cI was also listening to these \u201950s mood albums like Jackie Gleason\u2019s 'Music to Make You Misty\u2019 and Frank Sinatra's 'In The Wee Small Hours.' I wanted to do a tribute to a mood album.\u201d In a similar style to the covers of such albums, the artwork was painted by Los Angeles American Noir artist\u00a0Gina Higgins,\u00a0who also painted the cover for\u00a0On The Train Ride Home\u00a0and worked closely with the band on the concept.While The Paper Kite\u2019s songs explore longing and compulsions, Sam\u2019s own obsession lies in breaking elusive sound-emotion barriers. \u201cIt's a delicate responsibility to try and be sincere, but I think if there's never a lack of feeling, it's earnest to say the least\u201d.", "html": "<P><STRONG>THE PAPER KITES</STRONG></P><P><A HREF=\"https://www.facebook.com/thepaperkitesband/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Facebook</A>\u00a0|\u00a0<A HREF=\"https://www.instagram.com/thepaperkites/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Instagram</A>\u00a0|<A HREF=\"https://twitter.com/thepaperkites\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">\u00a0Twitter</A></P><P><STRONG>About the Show:</STRONG></P><P><EM>Doors 7:30pm // Show 8:30pm</EM></P><P><EM>Tickets on sale Thursday, April 18 at 10am</EM></P><P>\u00a0\u201cOur hotel window in New York City looked straight into the apartment building across the street.

The albums\u2019 concept came to Sam while on tour -\u00a0\u201cIt came from watching people really, being in unfamiliar cities, observing other people's lives. I remember the band was staying in a hotel on 57th\u00a0street in Manhattan and we'd come home from wherever we'd been. Our hotel window in New York City looked straight into the apartment building across the street. You could see all these windows lighting up and people getting home from their nights out. We just sat there and watched them. It was fascinating. It was living art.\u201d</P><P>\u201cGive Me Your Fire, Give Me Your Rain\u201d\u00a0takes over from where On The Train Ride Home left off. Josh Bentley's punching drums making a statement that the record is a slightly different affair from the quiet solitude of the previous offering. A lush sonic tidal wave of midnight melancholy sets the tone of longing, loss and hope echoed through everything that follows.</P><P>The band recorded the Manhattan street noise from the window of their 57th\u00a0street hotel, adding it to the lilting meditation \u201cMidtown Waitress,\u201d Sam tells the story of being alone in London bar years ago, where an elderly woman who turned out to be a pianist for the ballet scribbled down a melody on a piece of paper, gifting it to him, naming it \u201cThe Encounter.\u201d During the recording session, Sam dug out that piece of paper, transforming it into a woozy, sax-based coda to \u201cMidtown Waitress.\u201d</P><P>\u201cMusic is so much more purposeful and devastating when it makes you feel exposed,\u201d says Sam. Take \u201cDeep Burn Blue,\u201d a song about a girl who won\u2019t leave her room. \u201cIt\u2019s that feeling of being so inside your own thoughts that it\u2019s debilitating.\u201d (If that weren\u2019t gutting enough, the song even references Nick Drake with the line, \u201cYou like the sound of a pink moon cry/Lying on the floor as the day goes by.\u201d) Its foil is \u201cWhen It Hurts You,\u201d a harmonic lament about a man, locked-out of his apartment, making phone calls and yelling apologies from the street below. Says Sam; \u201cYou\u2019re hoping the next morning things will smooth over, but you know it probably won't.\u201d</P><P>Sam wrote 30 songs across three months. \u201cIt certainly consumed me. I was exhausted by the end of it,\u201d he says,\u00a0\u201cI didn't stop writing until Christina told me I had to stop.\u201d</P><P>Christina Lacy takes lead vocals on \u201cMess We Made\u201d, her first lead song since the bands debut album. Sam says\u00a0\u201cI remember we had planned to have her singing lead vocals on the last record (twelvefour) \u2013 but our producer at the time felt it sounded as if she was just singing my songs and wasn't making them her own \u2013 so we decided that if she was singing on a record it had to be songs that she'd written and had an emotional connection to, and she did just that.\u201d</P><P>Authenticity is important to Sam, who penned many of the lyrics for both albums while on the road,\u00a0composing both albums in Melbourne. Amongst his many influences \u2013 film played a part. \u201cI had films playing on the wall of my studio: \u2018Lost In Translation,\u2019 \u2018Rear Window,\u2019 \u2018Lost Highway\u2019,\u201d he explains. In that vein, he wrote the piano-based track \u201cDoes It Ever Cross Your Mind\u201d while working at a cinema.</P><P>Immersed in an aural diet of blues and jazz, \u201cI was also listening to these \u201950s mood albums like Jackie Gleason\u2019s 'Music to Make You Misty\u2019 and Frank Sinatra's 'In The Wee Small Hours.' I wanted to do a tribute to a mood album.\u201d In a similar style to the covers of such albums, the artwork was painted by Los Angeles American Noir artist\u00a0Gina Higgins,\u00a0who also painted the cover for\u00a0On The Train Ride Home\u00a0and worked closely with the band on the concept.</P><P>While The Paper Kite\u2019s songs explore longing and compulsions, Sam\u2019s own obsession lies in breaking elusive sound-emotion barriers. \u201cIt's a delicate responsibility to try and be sincere, but I think if there's never a lack of feeling, it's earnest to say the least\u201d.</P>"}, "id": "60140012396", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-paper-kites-thalia-hall-tickets-60140012396?aff=ebapi", "start": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2019-10-14T19:30:00", "utc": "2019-10-15T00:30:00Z"}, "end": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2019-10-15T06:00:00", "utc": "2019-10-15T11:00:00Z"}, "organization_id": "224181606708", "created": "2019-04-09T16:55:25Z", "changed": "2019-05-31T04:20:18Z", "published": "2019-04-10T17:50:32Z", "capacity": null, "capacity_is_custom": null, "status": "live", "currency": "USD", "listed": true, "shareable": true, "online_event": false, "tx_time_limit": 480, "hide_start_date": false, "hide_end_date": true, "locale": "en_US", "is_locked": false, "privacy_setting": "unlocked", "is_series": false, "is_series_parent": false, "inventory_type": "limited", "is_reserved_seating": false, "show_pick_a_seat": false, "show_seatmap_thumbnail": false, "show_colors_in_seatmap_thumbnail": false, "source": "queue", "is_free": false, "version": "4.0.0", "summary": "THE PAPER KITESFacebook\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0TwitterAbout the Show:Doors 7:30pm // Show 8:30pmTickets on sale Thursday, April 18 at 10am\u00a0\u201cOur hotel", "logo_id": "60066636", "organizer_id": "14941061407", "venue_id": "20880651", "category_id": "103", "subcategory_id": "3999", "format_id": null, "resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/events/60140012396/", "is_externally_ticketed": false, "music_properties": {"resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/events/60140012396/music_properties/", "age_restriction": "17+", "presented_by": null, "door_time": null}, "ticket_availability": {"has_available_tickets": true, "minimum_ticket_price": {"currency": "USD", "value": 2500, "major_value": "25.00", "display": "25.00 USD"}, "maximum_ticket_price": {"currency": "USD", "value": 4500, "major_value": "45.00", "display": "45.00 USD"}, "is_sold_out": false, "start_sales_date": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2019-04-16T10:00:00", "utc": "2019-04-16T15:00:00Z"}, "waitlist_available": false}, "format": null, "venue": {"address": {"address_1": "1807 South Allport Street", "address_2": null, "city": "Chicago", "region": "IL", "postal_code": "60608", "country": "US", "latitude": "41.8577", "longitude": "-87.6572", "localized_address_display": "1807 South Allport Street, Chicago, IL 60608", "localized_area_display": "Chicago, IL", "localized_multi_line_address_display": ["1807 South Allport Street", "Chicago, IL 60608"]}, "resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/venues/20880651/", "id": "20880651", "age_restriction": null, "capacity": null, "name": "Thalia Hall", "latitude": "41.8577", "longitude": "-87.6572"}, "basic_inventory_info": {"has_ticket_classes": true, "has_inventory_tiers": false, "has_ticket_rules": false, "has_add_ons": false, "has_donations": false}, "bookmark_info": {"bookmarked": false}, "logo": {"crop_mask": {"top_left": {"x": 0, "y": 0}, "width": 627, "height": 313}, "original": {"url": "https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F60066636%2F224181606708%2F1%2Foriginal.20190409-165540?auto=compress&s=1ebf302b67032d267211a41d06474f8e", "width": 627, "height": 417}, "id": "60066636", "url": "https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F60066636%2F224181606708%2F1%2Foriginal.20190409-165540?h=200&w=450&auto=compress&rect=0%2C0%2C627%2C313&s=8c6f0146ab2fb3a028ea8bccde9affd0", "aspect_ratio": "2.003194888178913738019169329", "edge_color": null, "edge_color_set": true}}, {"name": {"text": "Mark Guiliana Beat Music", "html": "Mark Guiliana Beat Music"}, "description": {"text": "DOORS: 7:00pm \u00a0| \u00a0SHOW: 8:00pm\nTo see a detailed seat map, please choose \"Tickets\" in the upper righthand corner, select your ticket choices & click \"view on map.\"\u00a0\nAbout the Artist\nGenre:\u00a0Nu Jazz\nHailed by The New York Times as \u201ca drummer around whom a cult of admiration has formed,\u201d Mark Guiliana brings the same adventurous spirit, eclectic palette and gift for spontaneous invention to a staggering range of styles. Equally virtuosic playing acoustic jazz, boundary-stretching electronic music, or next-level rock, he\u2019s become a key collaborator with such original sonic thinkers as Brad Mehldau, Meshell Ndegeocello, Donny McCaslin, Matisyahu, and the late, great David Bowie.\nGuiliana\u2019s forward-leaping BEAT MUSIC is more than a band \u2013 it\u2019s a community. Over the last decade the drummer has gathered around him a family of like-minded artists who share a passion for the limitless possibilities of electronic music combined with an in-the-moment creativity rooted in jazz improvisation. On April 12, Mot\u00e9ma Music will release Guiliana\u2019s third plunge into that vast musical ocean, the emphatically titled BEAT MUSIC! BEAT MUSIC! BEAT MUSIC! (available now for pre-order). The in-your-face exclamation of that title is no accident; Guiliana\u2019s third recording with his BEAT MUSIC cohort is a bold and vigorous exploration of window-rattling grooves, cinematic imagery, ecstatic atmospheres and a captivating tapestry of textures and voices.To realize his ambitious vision for the project, Guiliana has enlisted a host of collaborators who\u2019ve become part of the BEAT MUSIC community over the years, including such genre-defying artists as bassists Chris Morrissey, Stu Brooks, Jonathan Maron, and Tim Lefebvre; keyboardists Jason Lindner, BIGYUKI, and Jeff Babko; electronicists Troy Zeigler and Steve Wall; and spoken word samples from longtime collaborators Cole Whittle and Jeff Taylor, as well as Guiliana\u2019s wife, singer Gretchen Parlato (along with his son, Marley).\u201cI feel very lucky to have people that I genuinely consider to be my favorite musicians as part of the BEAT MUSIC family,\u201d Guiliana says. \u201cIt was important for me to have all of those collaborators represented on this record, to reap the rewards of the hundreds of hours of gigs we\u2019ve spent improvising and discovering together.\u201d\u2028\u2028BEAT MUSIC! BEAT MUSIC! BEAT MUSIC! doesn\u2019t feature improvisation in the traditional sense that Guiliana\u2019s previous release, the acoustic quartet album Jersey, did. The music was composed entirely by Guiliana, albeit drawn from his extensive interactions with each of these musicians. But each of his collaborators brings a distinctive voice and attitude to the mix, so that even when playing a thoroughly written line they imbue each note with an individual essence.\n\u201cEven when I\u2019m asking the musicians in BEAT MUSIC to play a part, I\u2019m still very much asking them to play it the way they play,\u201d Guiliana explains. \u201cThis music is mostly through-composed, but there\u2019s microscopic improvising in every moment. In each note there are sonic choices to be made about articulation, duration of notes, where to leave space, and myriad aspects like that. Those things might not be considered \u2018improvising\u2019 in a jazz sense, but in this genre those decisions make a world of difference. No decision I could make would be better than what these guys choose to do; they really bring the music to life.\u201d\nGuiliana took a circuitous route to electronic music. He initially came to the drums via the grunge-dominated music of his teenage years: Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden (whose drummer, Matt Cameron, would later enlist Guiliana for his own solo project). As he began to study the instrument, he was introduced to jazz in high school and was captivated by the music\u2019s complexity, nuances and diversity. Leaving the relative isolation of his suburban New Jersey home to find a wealth of like-minded acquaintances at William Paterson University, he heard Feed Me Weird Things, the debut album by UK electronica pioneer Squarepusher, for the first time. That opened up a whole new world of sonic possibilities for Guiliana, who began to pursue electronic music in parallel with jazz.\nNo matter the focus of a particular album or project, Guiliana\u2019s music blends those three major influences in varying balances: the raw power and intensity of hard rock; the spiritual questing of John Coltrane and the aggressive musical curiosity of Miles Davis; the brain-twisting manipulations and cut-up hybridizations of Squarepusher and Aphex Twin.\nThose diverse influences have converged in different ways throughout Guiliana\u2019s career. On one end of the spectrum is his Jazz Quartet and on the opposite is BEAT MUSIC, with which he\u2019s recorded twice before \u2013 on a self-titled 2012 EP as well as the 2014 album The Los Angeles Improvisations \u2013 and the similarly-inclined outings A Form of Truth (2013) and My Life Starts Now (2014).\u2028\u2028In between are a multitude of combinations, from the electro-acoustic duo Mehliana with Brad Mehldau to the increasingly electronic-influenced work of the Donny McCaslin Quartet, which also features Lindner and Lefebvre. Those four players, three of whom are featured on this album, also became the core band for David Bowie\u2019s acclaimed final release, Blackstar. The chameleonic rock icon specifically cited BEAT MUSIC\u2019s Los Angeles Improvisations as a guidepost for that album\u2019s enrapturing sound.\n\u201cBeing in the same room as David and watching him realize his vision was huge for me,\u201d Guiliana says. \u201cHe balanced knowing from the outset what he truly wanted to do with being extremely open and creating a very democratic environment. Those are seemingly contradictory qualities, but he so beautifully danced between the two, attacking every moment in the music with great spirit and love, making the art that he believed in. I really try to carry that with me.\u201d\nBEAT MUSIC! BEAT MUSIC! BEAT MUSIC! does that vividly, from the implacable, steamrolling pulse of opener \u201cGIRL\u201d through the retro sheen of \u201cHOME\u201d straight to the glistening reggae grooves of finale \u201cSTREAM.\u201d The dub mesmerism of \u201cBUD\u201d deepens its already mysterious layers with a half-heard, one-sided phone message, while the insistent \u201cBULLET\u201d features a Japanese voice seeming to echo through a PA system. The dance-y \u201cROAST\u201d undergirds a forceful diatribe, followed by the bouncy zigs and zags of \u201cHUMAN.\u201d \u2028\u2028While most of the spoken word elements of the album are used as almost instrumental elements, introducing unpredictable textures and intriguing ambiguities into the songs, many of the pieces are also profoundly personal. \u201cBLOOM\u201d offers an intimate glimpse into Guiliana\u2019s family life, with a tender moment between his wife and son. \u201cBONES,\u201d meanwhile, features the bandleader himself reciting a poem inspired by the recent death of his mother.\nThat meld of the communal and the personal is just one of many distinctive fusions that make BEAT MUSIC! BEAT MUSIC! BEAT MUSIC! the striking and singular album that it is \u2013 including blends of the electronic and acoustic, the composed and spontaneous, and deeply-rooted inspirations channeled into perceptive, forward-looking modern invention.\u2028\nWebsiteFAQsPLEASE CLICK\u00a0HERE\u00a0FOR A MORE DETAILED FAQ.\u00a0\n\n\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

And the world has indeed woken up and discovered him, helping him amass over 18 million views on YouTube. In addition to headlining major festivals, clubs and theatres throughout North America, Europe and Australia, he has shared the stage and toured with Bo Diddley, Buddy Guy, Greg Allman, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Randy Bachman, Little Feat, Jonny Lang, Serena Ryder, and more. Andersen nabbed the 2013 and 2016 European Blues Award for Best Solo/Acoustic Act, three Maple Blues Awards in 2012, and was the first ever Canadian to take home top honours in the solo/duo category at the 2010 International Blues Challenge in Memphis. Since the release of Weightless in early 2014, Andersen has received a JUNO nomination for Roots & Traditional Album of the Year, a CIMA Road Gold award, and six Maple Blues Awards for Male Vocalist of the Year.\nUnbridled joy springs eternal from Halfway Home by Morning. Recorded live off the floor in Nashville, Tennessee, celebrated songwriter Matt Andersen\u2019s tenth album collects all the essential elements for a down-home ramble and shoots them through with enough electrifying energy to drive the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll faithful to simmer, shimmy, and shake. Over its lucky 13 tracks, he explores every facet of his sound\u2014sweat-soaked soul, incendiary rhythm and blues, heartbroken folk, and gritty Americana\u2014and binds them together with palpable heart, as the band leaves everything they\u2019ve got on the sweet old hardwood of the Southern Ground studio, in the same spot that legends like Neil Young, Emmylou Harris, and Jerry Lee Lewis turned up the volume \u2018til it couldn\u2019t go up anymore.\u00a0\nAlong with the infiltrating buzz of Music City putting its stamp on the record, the studio itself became like a second home for Matt and the band. He and bassist Mike Farrington would routinely kick back with a drink and just listen to the horn section reminisce about the players they\u2019d shared the stage with, and the kitchen took on its typical all-important role as war room, the spot where meals brought the whole crew together to plot next steps. Sometimes it\u2019s tension that shapes a record. But what Halfway Home by Morning offers is soul rejuvenation, looking outward at the anxious state of the world and offering a helping hand, or searching inward to clarify what really matters. And to make a record like that, with warmth and verve, you need to keep your comrades close and feelin\u2019 right. \u201cThere really is nothing like listening back in the studio and everybody has the same smile on their face over what we\u2019re hearing,\u201d Matt says. \u201cYou can\u2019t fake the vibe of musicians playing together, responding to the choices others are making in that moment.\u201d\nOf course, fake vibes were never a threat to Matt. The native New Brunswicker has proven time and time again, on stages everywhere from clubs to theatres, that he\u2019s the genuine article. And Halfway Home by Morning is as honest and compromise free as anything he\u2019s ever done. It stands apart, though, injected with that feelgood swagger that comes from everyone making a racket in the same room. \u201cWhat Would Your Mama Say?\u201d opens things up on with a slithering groove, introducing us to the velvet smooth backing vocals of The McCrary Sisters. Amy Helm joins the party to slow burn the place down on \u201cSomething to Lose,\u201d a righteously tender duet that explores the long, scarred, and loving history of a relationship. \u201cGasoline\u201d blazes appropriately with horn blasts and tambourine shuffle, as Matt urges all good people of the world: \u201cLet\u2019s start living and forgiving like we\u2019re running out of time.\u201d The acoustic bounce of \u201cLong Rider\u201d belies its road dog lament, pumping ragged soul like they\u2019ve got just enough in the tank to get home. \u201cBeen My Last\u201d is a devotional for the ages, with pedal steel sweeping in to burst your heart. And things finish on a relatively sparse, but overwhelmingly poignant note: \u201cQuarter on the Ground (A Song For Uncle Joe)\u201d recalls a conversation between Matt\u2019s mother and uncle, as the latter wishes he could hear Joe\u2019s voice over the phone just one more time.\nIt should come as no surprise that such a commanding performer, set loose on tape, has built a record that\u2019ll make you dance uncontrollably, weep unashamedly, and fill up any dark spots in your soul with a blast of sonic light. Nearly two decades into his career, still armed with his signature room-shaking, heart-quaking voice, Matt Andersen can\u2019t fail. Halfway Home by Morning is the sound of an artist doing what he was born to do\u2014laying his soul bare using the music that can\u2019t help but run through him. And doing it with more jubilation than he ever has before.\n\nFAQs\nPLEASE CLICK HERE FOR A DETAILED FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

Among her recorded works are Child Ballads, Young Man in America, and Hadestown, the latter of which she expanded into a theatre show. Hadestown debuted off-Broadway in 2016 at New York Theatre Workshop, and will open at London\u2019s National Theatre in November 2018 before transferring to Broadway. She has headlined shows around the world, and opened tours with Bon Iver, Josh Ritter, Punch Brothers and Patty Griffin. If there's a common thread in Mitchell's work it's that she's as interested in the world around her as the one inside her.
