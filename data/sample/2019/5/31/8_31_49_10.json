Blood and Bones captures Schneider at a unique, and distinct, place. \u201cMost of the songs are about this phase of my life,\u201d he admits. \u201cI\u2019m re-married, I have a 2-year-old baby daughter who was born over two months premature because my wife had life threatening preeclampsia. So dealing with that traumatic event while getting older and looking at death in a realistic, matter of fact way, experiencing the most joy I\u2019ve ever experienced along with feelings of utter despondency in a way that would have been impossible to experience earlier in my life, all comes out in the songs. My relationship with my wife is the longest committed relationship I\u2019ve ever been in, so there was a lot of unchartered territory there to write about.\nThe songs on Blood and Bones reflect this. Recorded quickly with producer Dwight Baker, who has worked with Schneider on 6 of his previous releases, the album highlights the chemistry that Schneider and his backing band of Austin\u2019s very best musicians have developed while relentlessly playing live, most notably at the monthly residency Schneider has held at Austin\u2019s Saxon Pub for the last 19 years. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to overthink the songs,\u201d Schneider says. \u201cI really respect Dwight\u2019s ability to make great calls when it comes to what works and isn\u2019t working when we are recording the songs. I felt pretty good about the quality of the songwriting, so I figured that would come through in the end if we just went in and played them the way I do live.\u201d\nWhile the performance and production are stellar, the songwriting finds Schneider in a particularly reflective mode. Sure, there are live favorites like \u201cMake Drugs Get Money\u201d and \u201cTexaco\u201d that will get even the most reserved crowds dancing. But more often the album finds Schneider reflecting on marriage, parenthood, and mortality. \u201cI wish I could make you see how wonderful everything is most of the time, but I\u2019m only blood and bones,\u201d he sings on the title track, a meditation on the beauty and the limits of marriage. Later, on \u201cEasy,\u201d he tells his daughter \u201cit\u2019s always been a scary thing to do, to let my heart fall down into the endless blue, but it\u2019s easy with you.\u201d Through it all, there is a clear sense of mortality, of just how fleeting all of this is. \u201cThe hours and days stack up in the mirror,\u201d he sings on \u201cHours and Days\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re just snowmen waiting for the summer\u201d he sings on \u201cSnowmen\u201d, before adding \u201cwe can\u2019t bring them back, can\u2019t bring nothing back.\u201d\nOne thing Schneider has excelled at in his career is bringing audiences back. Though he has received little national press or major label support, he has managed to become one of the biggest acts in Austin, if not in Texas. His fans, who often discover him from being brought to his shows by their friends, are fiercely loyal. Many have attended dozens or even hundreds of shows. Thanks to these fans, Schneider has won more Austin Music Awards than any other musician, including Best Songwriter, Best Musician, and Best Male Vocals, rounding in at 54 total awards to date.\nIn retrospect, it appears inevitable that Bob Schneider would become an artist. He was born in Michigan and raised in Germany, where his father pursued a career as a professional opera singer. As a boy, Schneider studied piano and guitar, often performing at family parties and backing his father on drums at nightclubs throughout his youth in Germany and Texas. He went on to study art \u2013 his other primary passion and avocation \u2013 at the University of Texas El Paso, before moving to Austin and establishing himself as a musician. He performs relentlessly, creates new music compulsively, writes poetry, and regularly shows his visual art in galleries around Austin. With Blood and Bones , Schneider further cements his reputation as one of the most versatile, inventive, and engaging songwriters working today.\nWebsite\n\nFAQs\nPLEASE CLICK\u00a0HERE\u00a0FOR A MORE DETAILED FAQ.\u00a0\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

at 10am CT.\u00a0\nPlease click HERE for a detailed FAQ.\n\nABOUT THE SHOW\nGATES: 6pm\u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0SHOW: 7pm\nTemperance Brewery is located at\u00a02000 Dempster Street in Evanston, IL.\u00a0\n\nDigable Planets\nGenre:\u00a0Alturnative Hip-hop\nDigable Planets are an American alternative hip hop trio based in Brooklyn, New York, composed of Ishmael \u201cButterfly\u201d Butler (from Seattle), Mary Ann \u201cLadybug Mecca\u201d Vieira (from Silver Spring, Maryland) and Craig \u201cDoodlebug\u201d Irving (from Philadelphia).\nButler and Irving met in Philadelphia in the late 1980s; Vieira and Irving had been a couple while attending Howard University. Originally from Seattle, Butler was interning at Sleeping Bag Records in New York and would visit his grandmother in Philadelphia where Irving was living and rapping with an outfit called the Dread Poets Society (later known as the 7 OD\u2019s). The initial demos recorded under the name Digable Planets featured only Butler. After a brief stint with two other members, Butler began collaborating with Irving and Vieira in 1989.\n1992\u20131993: Reachin\u2019 (A New Refutation of Time and Space)\nThe group signed to Pendulum Records in 1992 and all three band members moved to New York, where Butler and Irving became roommates. Their debut album Reachin\u2019 (A New Refutation of Time and Space) was released in 1993 and certified gold by the RIAA. The album\u2019s lead single, \u201cRebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat)\u201d became a crossover hit, peaking at #15 on Billboard magazine\u2019s singles chart, earning gold certification by the RIAA, and winning Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. The track peaked at #67 in the UK Singles Chart in February 1995.\n1994\u20131995 Blowout Comb and breakup\nThe group\u2019s second album Blowout Comb was released in 1994. The album was noted by critics as a stark departure from the previous album, being darker, less hook-oriented and more overtly political in its references to Black Panther and Communist imagery. Writing for Spin in December 1994, Craig Marks declared it \u201c\u2026 a beguiling, demanding, damn near revolutionary follow-up.\u201dBlowout Comb features guest appearances from artists Jeru the Damaja, Sulaiman and Guru of Gang Starr.\nIn the same year the group appeared on the Red Hot Organization\u2019s compilation album, Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African American community, was heralded as \u201cAlbum of the Year\u201d by Time magazine.\nThe band subsequently disbanded in early 1995 citing \u201ccreative differences\u201d.\n2005\u20132015: Reunions\nIn February 2005 the trio reunited and embarked on a reunion tour, which was followed by the release of a compilation album titled Beyond the Spectrum: The Creamy Spy Chronicles on October 15, 2005 that combined previously released material with remixes and B-sides.\nFrom 2009 to 2011, Butler and Irving toured across the U.S., Canada, and Europe with a live band, the Cosmic Funk Orchestra. Support acts included Camp Lo and Butler\u2019s Shabazz Palaces.\nThe group performed at Numbers, in Houston, Texas, on May 15, 2010, alongside the hip hop duo Camp Lo. During an interview with the Houston Chronicle near the time of this show, Doodlebug stated that a new single would be released, called \u201cFresh Out\u201d, and that a new album was planned for digital release in summer of 2010. The group also performed alongside hip-hop group The Pharcyde at the North by Northeast music festival in Toronto, Ontario on June 19, 2011.\nA reunion show scheduled for December 2012 in Seattle, Washington was cancelled days before the performance. When asked in a subsequent interview about the group\u2019s status, Butler stated \u201cI think it\u2019s the end.\u201d\nDespite Butler\u2019s previous statement, it was announced in October 2015 that the trio would again reunite for a concert at Seattle\u2019s Neptune Theatre on December 30 alongside Shabazz Palaces.\nButler released Bright Black under the moniker Cherrywine in 2003 before going on to collaborate with multi-instrumentalist Tendai \u2018Baba\u2019 Maraire as Shabazz Palaces. In 2009 the duo self-released two EPs, Shabazz Palaces and Of Light before becoming the first Hip-hop act to be signed to Sub Pop Records. Their debut LP Black Up was released in 2011 followed by Lese Majesty in 2014, both to wide critical acclaim. Butler has also been signed to Sub Pop\u2019s A&R division and is helping the label build its repertoire of artists that are \u2018imaginative\u2019 and \u2018daring\u2019. Butler and Maraire later collaborated with Hussein Kalonji as Chimurenga Renaissance to release riZe vadZimu riZe in March 2014 on Brick Lane Records.\nIrving, also known as Cee Knowledge, tours with Cee Knowledge & the Cosmic Funk Orchestra and has released two albums in limited edition on FarmHouse Records.\nVieira (now known as Lady Mecca) released Trip The Light Fantastic in 2005 and has collaborated regularly with other musicians, notably on Legacy/Sony\u2019s Billie Holiday Remixed and Reimagined album (on the song \u201cSpreadin\u2019 Rhythm Around\u201d), Del tha Funkee Homosapien\u2019s Eleventh Hour (on the song \u201cI Got You\u201d), and with hip-hop supergroup eMC on the song \u201cThe Show\u201d. Vieira also contributed the voice of Tracey Triceratops on the Dino-5 children\u2019s CD through Ropeadope Records as well as continuing to perform as DJ Lady Mecca.\n\n\nKweku Collins\nKweku Collins is a 21-year old rapper/producer/songwriter from Evanston, IL that has been making music for most of his life. Born into a musical family, Kweku joined his dad on-stage playing African drums at the early age of 4. As a teenager, Kweku transitioned to making his own music, crafting bedroom classics throughout high school. In 2015, just shy of his high school graduation, Kweku joined the Chicago's indie rap outfit, Closed Sessions and shortly after released his debut EP, Say It Here While It's Safe. The EP received critical praise and landed Kweku on Pigeons and Planes 20 rappers under 20 List. In 2016, Kweku followed up with Nat Love - a proper LP that garnered an 8.0 Pitchfork Review, produced a Pitchfork Best New Track, and landed Kweku in publications such as The FADER, Billboard, Chicago Reader, and more. Kweku's latest release, Grey, is available now via iTunes, Spotify, Tidal, and other digital retailers.\nWebsite", "html": "<H2><STRONG>OUT OF SPACE 2019:\u00a0<SPAN><SPAN>Digable Planets w/ Kweku Collins</SPAN></SPAN></STRONG></H2>\n<H2><EM>presented by SPACE &amp; Temperance Beer Company</EM></H2>\n<P CLASS=\"p1\"><BR></P>\n<P CLASS=\"p1\"><STRONG><EM>All tickets go on-sale to the public on Friday, March 15, at 10am CT.\u00a0</EM></STRONG></P>\n<P>Please click <A HREF=\"https://www.spacepresents.com/faq-temperance\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">HERE</A> for a detailed FAQ.</P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<H2>ABOUT THE SHOW</H2>\n<P><STRONG>GATES</STRONG>: 6pm\u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0<STRONG>SHOW: </STRONG>7pm</P>\n<P><A HREF=\"http://temperancebeer.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Temperance Brewery</A> is located at\u00a02000 Dempster Street in Evanston, IL.\u00a0</P>\n<H3><BR></H3>\n<H2><SPAN>Digable Planets</SPAN></H2>\n<H3><STRONG>Genre:</STRONG>\u00a0Alturnative Hip-hop</H3>\n<P>Digable Planets are an American alternative hip hop trio based in Brooklyn, New York, composed of Ishmael \u201cButterfly\u201d Butler (from Seattle), Mary Ann \u201cLadybug Mecca\u201d Vieira (from Silver Spring, Maryland) and Craig \u201cDoodlebug\u201d Irving (from Philadelphia).</P>\n<P>Butler and Irving met in Philadelphia in the late 1980s; Vieira and Irving had been a couple while attending Howard University. Originally from Seattle, Butler was interning at Sleeping Bag Records in New York and would visit his grandmother in Philadelphia where Irving was living and rapping with an outfit called the Dread Poets Society (later known as the 7 OD\u2019s). The initial demos recorded under the name Digable Planets featured only Butler. After a brief stint with two other members, Butler began collaborating with Irving and Vieira in 1989.</P>\n<P>1992\u20131993: Reachin\u2019 (A New Refutation of Time and Space)</P>\n<P>The group signed to Pendulum Records in 1992 and all three band members moved to New York, where Butler and Irving became roommates. Their debut album Reachin\u2019 (A New Refutation of Time and Space) was released in 1993 and certified gold by the RIAA. The album\u2019s lead single, \u201cRebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat)\u201d became a crossover hit, peaking at #15 on Billboard magazine\u2019s singles chart, earning gold certification by the RIAA, and winning Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. The track peaked at #67 in the UK Singles Chart in February 1995.</P>\n<P>1994\u20131995 Blowout Comb and breakup</P>\n<P>The group\u2019s second album Blowout Comb was released in 1994. The album was noted by critics as a stark departure from the previous album, being darker, less hook-oriented and more overtly political in its references to Black Panther and Communist imagery. Writing for Spin in December 1994, Craig Marks declared it \u201c\u2026 a beguiling, demanding, damn near revolutionary follow-up.\u201dBlowout Comb features guest appearances from artists Jeru the Damaja, Sulaiman and Guru of Gang Starr.</P>\n<P>In the same year the group appeared on the Red Hot Organization\u2019s compilation album, Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African American community, was heralded as \u201cAlbum of the Year\u201d by Time magazine.</P>\n<P>The band subsequently disbanded in early 1995 citing \u201ccreative differences\u201d.</P>\n<P>2005\u20132015: Reunions</P>\n<P>In February 2005 the trio reunited and embarked on a reunion tour, which was followed by the release of a compilation album titled Beyond the Spectrum: The Creamy Spy Chronicles on October 15, 2005 that combined previously released material with remixes and B-sides.</P>\n<P>From 2009 to 2011, Butler and Irving toured across the U.S., Canada, and Europe with a live band, the Cosmic Funk Orchestra. Support acts included Camp Lo and Butler\u2019s Shabazz Palaces.</P>\n<P>The group performed at Numbers, in Houston, Texas, on May 15, 2010, alongside the hip hop duo Camp Lo. During an interview with the Houston Chronicle near the time of this show, Doodlebug stated that a new single would be released, called \u201cFresh Out\u201d, and that a new album was planned for digital release in summer of 2010. The group also performed alongside hip-hop group The Pharcyde at the North by Northeast music festival in Toronto, Ontario on June 19, 2011.</P>\n<P>A reunion show scheduled for December 2012 in Seattle, Washington was cancelled days before the performance. When asked in a subsequent interview about the group\u2019s status, Butler stated \u201cI think it\u2019s the end.\u201d</P>\n<P>Despite Butler\u2019s previous statement, it was announced in October 2015 that the trio would again reunite for a concert at Seattle\u2019s Neptune Theatre on December 30 alongside Shabazz Palaces.</P>\n<P>Butler released Bright Black under the moniker Cherrywine in 2003 before going on to collaborate with multi-instrumentalist Tendai \u2018Baba\u2019 Maraire as Shabazz Palaces. In 2009 the duo self-released two EPs, Shabazz Palaces and Of Light before becoming the first Hip-hop act to be signed to Sub Pop Records. Their debut LP Black Up was released in 2011 followed by Lese Majesty in 2014, both to wide critical acclaim. Butler has also been signed to Sub Pop\u2019s A&R division and is helping the label build its repertoire of artists that are \u2018imaginative\u2019 and \u2018daring\u2019. Butler and Maraire later collaborated with Hussein Kalonji as Chimurenga Renaissance to release riZe vadZimu riZe in March 2014 on Brick Lane Records.</P>\n<P>Irving, also known as Cee Knowledge, tours with Cee Knowledge &amp; the Cosmic Funk Orchestra and has released two albums in limited edition on FarmHouse Records.</P>\n<P>Vieira (now known as Lady Mecca) released Trip The Light Fantastic in 2005 and has collaborated regularly with other musicians, notably on Legacy/Sony\u2019s Billie Holiday Remixed and Reimagined album (on the song \u201cSpreadin\u2019 Rhythm Around\u201d), Del tha Funkee Homosapien\u2019s Eleventh Hour (on the song \u201cI Got You\u201d), and with hip-hop supergroup eMC on the song \u201cThe Show\u201d. Vieira also contributed the voice of Tracey Triceratops on the Dino-5 children\u2019s CD through Ropeadope Records as well as continuing to perform as DJ Lady Mecca.</P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P><STRONG>Kweku Collins</STRONG></P>\n<P>Kweku Collins is a 21-year old rapper/producer/songwriter from Evanston, IL that has been making music for most of his life.

The gifted young musicians became fast friends and before long, bandmates. Having both grown up in musical families with professional pianists for fathers and vocalists for mothers, their shared influences bounced between classical, jazz, bluegrass, country, alt-rock, and the obscure.\nDubbing themselves after the musical notes that fall outside of a key signature, The Accidentals recorded and released a pair of independent albums in 2012 and 2013, the latter funded by a hugely successful Kickstarter. Their original songs revealed a band with wide-ranging influences but always true to their orchestral roots. National applause and attention followed, as did acclaimed collaborations with some fellow local artists and independent filmmakers. Other career highlights included scoring arrangements for a 75-piece orchestra to accompany them on their original songs as well as arranging pieces for an opera/dance production with Jennifer and Ryan Lott (Son Lux).\nThe past five years have seen The Accidentals perform over a thousand live shows, including headline dates, festival sets, and shared stages along such diverse acts as Keller Williams, Martin Sexton, Brandi Carlile, Andrew Bird, The Wailers, Joan Baez, and others. 2015 saw the band embark on their first full-scale national tour. Their SXSW debut saw them hailed by Billboard Magazine for \u201cdisplaying a genre-hopping range of influences and some smart songwriting skills to go with their abundant musical chops.\u201d\nNow, at long last, The Accidentals unveil their most compelling and finely honed work to date. Co-produced by Buist, Larson, and Dause with engineer Jason Lehning (Mat Kearney, Guster, George Jones, Alison Krauss) at Asheville, NC\u2019s Echo Mountain Recording, ODYSSEY sees the band joined by such friends and fans as acoustic guitar maestro Kaki King, bassist \u2013 and fellow Michigander \u2013 Dominic John Davis (Jack White, Beck), Carbon Leaf guitarist Carter Gravatt, Keller Williams and The Decemberists\u2019 Jenny Conlee, who spent three days in the studio alongside the band, lending her distinctive organ to a number of the album\u2019s key tracks.\n\u201cIt was a really collaborative process,\u201d says Larson. \u201cA lot of these songs had been hashed out at our live shows over the past few years, so we had a very strong idea of what we wanted in the arrangements.\nThe Accidentals\u2019 inviting spirit of shared creativity is perhaps best represented by the album\u2019s audacious first single, \u201cKW,\u201d showcasing the inimitable guitar work of Keller Williams, whose own virtuosic genre-agnostic approach towards music making inspired the song in the first place.\nFrom the orchestrated rock of \u201cMemorial Day\u201d to the album-closing \u201cBallad Tendered Gun\u201d \u2013 surprisingly, The Accidentals\u2019 first instrumental to be included on an LP \u2013 ODYSSEY is a strikingly dynamic work, both layered and unhurried, bittersweet yet life-affirming. Rich with literary references, whispers of nostalgia, and an unstoppable sense of forward motion, its songs were written independently by Buist and Larson and then arranged and refined by the group, creating a perfect yin/yang between individual introspection and dynamic cooperation, each artist bringing her own unique perspective to the process.\n\u201cWe rely on each other to create a balance,\u201d Buist says. \u201cI think that\u2019s the key to this band. Our styles of songwriting and arrangement are very different, so when they come together, they create this variation that couldn\u2019t happen any other way.\u201d\nThe goal as ever is to experiment and experience, exploring new ideas and approaches while always staying true to their roots. With ODYSSEY, The Accidentals have conjured a truly one of its kind sound and vision, booming with free-thinking musicality, wisdom, and an understanding that growth is a process, not something that happens overnight. The Accidentals are already moving forward on their amazing journey, rolling down the windows on an open road towards someplace that\u2019s both true and transcendent.\nWebsite\n\nFAQs\nPLEASE CLICK HERE FOR A DETAILED FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

The gifted young musicians became fast friends and before long, bandmates. Having both grown up in musical families with professional pianists for fathers and vocalists for mothers, their shared influences bounced between classical, jazz, bluegrass, country, alt-rock, and the obscure.</P>\n<P>Dubbing themselves after the musical notes that fall outside of a key signature, The Accidentals recorded and released a pair of independent albums in 2012 and 2013, the latter funded by a hugely successful Kickstarter. Their original songs revealed a band with wide-ranging influences but always true to their orchestral roots. National applause and attention followed, as did acclaimed collaborations with some fellow local artists and independent filmmakers. Other career highlights included scoring arrangements for a 75-piece orchestra to accompany them on their original songs as well as arranging pieces for an opera/dance production with Jennifer and Ryan Lott (Son Lux).</P>\n<P>The past five years have seen The Accidentals perform over a thousand live shows, including headline dates, festival sets, and shared stages along such diverse acts as Keller Williams, Martin Sexton, Brandi Carlile, Andrew Bird, The Wailers, Joan Baez, and others. 2015 saw the band embark on their first full-scale national tour. Their SXSW debut saw them hailed by Billboard Magazine for \u201cdisplaying a genre-hopping range of influences and some smart songwriting skills to go with their abundant musical chops.\u201d</P>\n<P>Now, at long last, The Accidentals unveil their most compelling and finely honed work to date. Co-produced by Buist, Larson, and Dause with engineer Jason Lehning (Mat Kearney, Guster, George Jones, Alison Krauss) at Asheville, NC\u2019s Echo Mountain Recording, ODYSSEY sees the band joined by such friends and fans as acoustic guitar maestro Kaki King, bassist \u2013 and fellow Michigander \u2013 Dominic John Davis (Jack White, Beck), Carbon Leaf guitarist Carter Gravatt, Keller Williams and The Decemberists\u2019 Jenny Conlee, who spent three days in the studio alongside the band, lending her distinctive organ to a number of the album\u2019s key tracks.</P>\n<P>\u201cIt was a really collaborative process,\u201d says Larson. \u201cA lot of these songs had been hashed out at our live shows over the past few years, so we had a very strong idea of what we wanted in the arrangements.</P>\n<P>The Accidentals\u2019 inviting spirit of shared creativity is perhaps best represented by the album\u2019s audacious first single, \u201cKW,\u201d showcasing the inimitable guitar work of Keller Williams, whose own virtuosic genre-agnostic approach towards music making inspired the song in the first place.</P>\n<P>From the orchestrated rock of \u201cMemorial Day\u201d to the album-closing \u201cBallad Tendered Gun\u201d \u2013 surprisingly, The Accidentals\u2019 first instrumental to be included on an LP \u2013 ODYSSEY is a strikingly dynamic work, both layered and unhurried, bittersweet yet life-affirming. Rich with literary references, whispers of nostalgia, and an unstoppable sense of forward motion, its songs were written independently by Buist and Larson and then arranged and refined by the group, creating a perfect yin/yang between individual introspection and dynamic cooperation, each artist bringing her own unique perspective to the process.</P>\n<P>\u201cWe rely on each other to create a balance,\u201d Buist says. \u201cI think that\u2019s the key to this band. Our styles of songwriting and arrangement are very different, so when they come together, they create this variation that couldn\u2019t happen any other way.\u201d</P>\n<P>The goal as ever is to experiment and experience, exploring new ideas and approaches while always staying true to their roots. With ODYSSEY, The Accidentals have conjured a truly one of its kind sound and vision, booming with free-thinking musicality, wisdom, and an understanding that growth is a process, not something that happens overnight. The Accidentals are already moving forward on their amazing journey, rolling down the windows on an open road towards someplace that\u2019s both true and transcendent.</P>\n<P><A HREF=\"https://www.theaccidentalsmusic.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Website</A></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<H2><STRONG>FAQs</STRONG></H2>\n<P><EM><STRONG>PLEASE CLICK <A HREF=\"http://evanstonspace.com/faq\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">HERE</A> FOR A DETAILED FAQ.</STRONG></EM></P>\n<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0</STRONG>Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.
