Quickly signed to esteemed British indie label Go!Discs, the group used its label advance to set up their own recording studio, Shabby Road, in nearby Kilmarnock, where they settled in to create three critically- acclaimed albums.\nThe first of these, Cake, was released in the summer of 1990 and featured debut single \"Obscurity Knocks\" and its follow-up \u201cOnly Tongue Can Tell\u201d, both of which became alternative radio hits in the USA, and introduced the group to what has become a loving and loyal fan base around the world. Their beloved second album, I've Seen Everything, came along in 1993, preceded by the lauded single \u201cHayfever.\u201d The group\u2019s next album, 1996\u2019s self-produced A Happy Pocket, featured four singles, including the band\u2019s much-loved cover of \"To Sir, With Love\".\nAfter leaving Go! Discs in 1998, the group kept a low profile until the release of their fourth album, Weightlifting, in the autumn of 2004. Extensive touring in support of that album followed, with shows in the UK, Europe, USA, Japan and Australia. In winter 2007/2008, they record a fifth studio album, In the Music, at Stratosphere Sound in Manhattan and on Martha's Vineyard. The group celebrated the album\u2019s release in 2009 with concerts and promotional appearances over the next two years in the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom. It was during the In the Music tours that the band began playing \u201chouse parties\u201d for fans, which have since become a staple of their touring schedule.\nIn early 2015, the group set up camp with producer Mike Mogis (Bright Eyes, Justin Townes Earle, First Aid Kit, Rilo Kiley) at his ARC Studios in Omaha, Nebraska to record their sixth LP. Released in April 2016, the album, Wild Pendulum, received a warm welcome from music critics and fans. The A.V. Club said \u201cWild Pendulum is lovingly crafted, with layers in all the right\nplaces,\u201d while Allmusic exclaimed the album is \u201cquite likely the best sophisticated guitar pop album anyone is likely to hear in 2016.\u201d The band returned to the road for the first time in five years, supporting the release with concerts in the United States, Scotland, England, Ireland and Japan.\nPaul, John and Francis hit the road as a three-piece unit in September 2017 for a six week acoustic tour of North America, playing nearly all of the 100+ songs they had written together over the last 30 years. The tour included sold-out shows in New York City and Los Angeles, amongst others, and was capped off with a second sell-out in Los Angeles, where the group filmed the show for a live CD/DVD, All Night In America (released in October 2018).\nTrashcan Sinatras toured again in 2018, in both their acoustic and full-band configurations. A 30 date North American acoustic \u201cOne Night, Two Albums\u201d tour, where they played Cake and I\u2019ve Seen Everything in their entirety, was followed by a full-band supporting slot in the UK with Del Amitri, as well as their own headline shows in the UK and elsewhere.\nIn 2019, the band is beginning the creative process for a new album, while its acoustic lineup reprises the \u201cOne Night, Two Albums\u201d tour concept. Spanning North America for six weeks in the Fall, the band will play both A Happy Pocket and Weightlifting (celebrating its 15 year anniversary) in their entirety.\nOfficial Studio Album Discography: 1990 - Cake1993 - I've Seen Everything1996 - A Happy Pocket2004 - Weightlifting 2009 - In the Music 2016 \u2013 Wild Pendulum\nWebsite\n\nFAQs\nPLEASE CLICK HERE FOR A DETAILED FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

Discs in 1998, the group kept a low profile until the release of their fourth album, Weightlifting, in the autumn of 2004. Extensive touring in support of that album followed, with shows in the UK, Europe, USA, Japan and Australia. In winter 2007/2008, they record a fifth studio album, In the Music, at Stratosphere Sound in Manhattan and on Martha's Vineyard. The group celebrated the album\u2019s release in 2009 with concerts and promotional appearances over the next two years in the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom. It was during the In the Music tours that the band began playing \u201chouse parties\u201d for fans, which have since become a staple of their touring schedule.</P>\n<P>In early 2015, the group set up camp with producer Mike Mogis (Bright Eyes, Justin Townes Earle, First Aid Kit, Rilo Kiley) at his ARC Studios in Omaha, Nebraska to record their sixth LP. Released in April 2016, the album, Wild Pendulum, received a warm welcome from music critics and fans. The A.V. Club said \u201cWild Pendulum is lovingly crafted, with layers in all the right</P>\n<P>places,\u201d while Allmusic exclaimed the album is \u201cquite likely the best sophisticated guitar pop album anyone is likely to hear in 2016.\u201d The band returned to the road for the first time in five years, supporting the release with concerts in the United States, Scotland, England, Ireland and Japan.</P>\n<P>Paul, John and Francis hit the road as a three-piece unit in September 2017 for a six week acoustic tour of North America, playing nearly all of the 100+ songs they had written together over the last 30 years. The tour included sold-out shows in New York City and Los Angeles, amongst others, and was capped off with a second sell-out in Los Angeles, where the group filmed the show for a live CD/DVD, All Night In America (released in October 2018).</P>\n<P>Trashcan Sinatras toured again in 2018, in both their acoustic and full-band configurations. A 30 date North American acoustic \u201cOne Night, Two Albums\u201d tour, where they played Cake and I\u2019ve Seen Everything in their entirety, was followed by a full-band supporting slot in the UK with Del Amitri, as well as their own headline shows in the UK and elsewhere.</P>\n<P>In 2019, the band is beginning the creative process for a new album, while its acoustic lineup reprises the \u201cOne Night, Two Albums\u201d tour concept. Spanning North America for six weeks in the Fall, the band will play both A Happy Pocket and Weightlifting (celebrating its 15 year anniversary) in their entirety.</P>\n<P><BR>Official Studio Album Discography: 1990 - Cake<BR>1993 - I've Seen Everything<BR>1996 - A Happy Pocket<BR>2004 - Weightlifting 2009 - In the Music 2016 \u2013 Wild Pendulum</P>\n<P><A HREF=\"https://trashcansinatras.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Website</A></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<H2><STRONG>FAQs</STRONG></H2>\n<P><EM><STRONG>PLEASE CLICK <A HREF=\"http://evanstonspace.com/faq\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">HERE</A> FOR A DETAILED FAQ.</STRONG></EM></P>\n<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0</STRONG>Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

This gift has been a matter of common knowledge since 2002, when Broussard released his debut album, Momentary Setback, which he recorded and released independently at age 20. It was no secret before then, going back to those lucky witnesses who heard him belt \"Johnny B. Goode\" onstage at age 5 while sitting in with his father's band - Louisiana Hall of Fame guitarist Ted Broussard\u2019s - legendary The Boogie Kings.\nIn 2004, he released his major-label debut; Carencro, after the Louisiana town where he was born and raised, and its thematic centerpiece was a hickory-smoked slab of Bayou soul called \u201cHome.\u201d That album and the subsequent ones that followed revealed Broussard as an old-school Southern soul singer blessed with a rarefied talent and innate stylistic and emotional authenticity.\nOn April 5th, Marc Broussard released a live album Home (The Dockside Sessions). Broussard wanted to offer his fans something different prior to the release of his next studio album. Rather than a standard greatest hits package or a perfunctory live album, he had something different in mind. His release Home (The Dockside Sessions) accomplishes both, but in a unique way. It provides the audio tracks from the various videos Broussard has compiled over the course of his career, all of them recorded live at Dockside Studios near his Lafayette Louisiana home. The album includes a telling remake of Broussard\u2019s signature song -- \u201cHome.\u201d\nAlthough each of the 15 songs represents Broussard\u2019s best known material and fan favorites from throughout his storied career, Home (The Dockside Sessions) is more than simply a reminder of past glories. The material has been retooled and reinterpreted in stripped down aural settings, the result of which provides an intimate opportunity to share the inherent emotion Broussard invested in each of these soulful sessions.\nWhile all the songs resonate as essential additives in Broussard\u2019s repertoire -- one informed by soul, blues, ballads and Americana \u2013 there is one song in particular that is of special significance to the artist himself. \u201cHome,\u201d the album\u2019s title track, dates back to the dawn of his career. Once an anthem of hope and determination, it\u2019s come to represent the tack and trajectory of both his life and career. Now, however, he sees the song in a different way, one that\u2019s reflected in his earnest and emotive delivery.\n\u201cThis song has given me a career,\u201d Broussard remarks. \u201cWithout it, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be where I am. However, when I hear the original, I hear a boy trying to sound like a big man. It needed a redo; something swampier and dirtier than before. Something that showed its age a little more honestly.\u201d Likewise, the connection with these videos is clear; these live performance videos have become an eagerly anticipated, ongoing endeavor. Collectively, they have garnered more than 30 million plays. His acoustic version of the classic \u201cCry to Me\u201d has gained over 11 million views alone on YouTube.\u00a0\nWebsite\n\nFAQs\nPLEASE CLICK HERE FOR A DETAILED FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

This gift has been a matter of common knowledge since 2002, when Broussard released his debut album, Momentary Setback, which he recorded and released independently at age 20. It was no secret before then, going back to those lucky witnesses who heard him belt \"Johnny B. Goode\" onstage at age 5 while sitting in with his father's band - Louisiana Hall of Fame guitarist Ted Broussard\u2019s - legendary The Boogie Kings.</P>\n<P>In 2004, he released his major-label debut; Carencro, after the Louisiana town where he was born and raised, and its thematic centerpiece was a hickory-smoked slab of Bayou soul called \u201cHome.\u201d That album and the subsequent ones that followed revealed Broussard as an old-school Southern soul singer blessed with a rarefied talent and innate stylistic and emotional authenticity.</P>\n<P>On April 5th, Marc Broussard released a live album Home (The Dockside Sessions). Broussard wanted to offer his fans something different prior to the release of his next studio album. Rather than a standard greatest hits package or a perfunctory live album, he had something different in mind. His release Home (The Dockside Sessions) accomplishes both, but in a unique way. It provides the audio tracks from the various videos Broussard has compiled over the course of his career, all of them recorded live at Dockside Studios near his Lafayette Louisiana home. The album includes a telling remake of Broussard\u2019s signature song -- \u201cHome.\u201d</P>\n<P>Although each of the 15 songs represents Broussard\u2019s best known material and fan favorites from throughout his storied career, Home (The Dockside Sessions) is more than simply a reminder of past glories. The material has been retooled and reinterpreted in stripped down aural settings, the result of which provides an intimate opportunity to share the inherent emotion Broussard invested in each of these soulful sessions.</P>\n<P>While all the songs resonate as essential additives in Broussard\u2019s repertoire -- one informed by soul, blues, ballads and Americana \u2013 there is one song in particular that is of special significance to the artist himself. \u201cHome,\u201d the album\u2019s title track, dates back to the dawn of his career. Once an anthem of hope and determination, it\u2019s come to represent the tack and trajectory of both his life and career. Now, however, he sees the song in a different way, one that\u2019s reflected in his earnest and emotive delivery.</P>\n<P>\u201cThis song has given me a career,\u201d Broussard remarks. \u201cWithout it, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be where I am. However, when I hear the original, I hear a boy trying to sound like a big man. It needed a redo; something swampier and dirtier than before. Something that showed its age a little more honestly.\u201d Likewise, the connection with these videos is clear; these live performance videos have become an eagerly anticipated, ongoing endeavor. Collectively, they have garnered more than 30 million plays. His acoustic version of the classic \u201cCry to Me\u201d has gained over 11 million views alone on YouTube.\u00a0</P>\n<P><A HREF=\"http://www.marcbroussard.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Website</A></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<H2><STRONG>FAQs</STRONG></H2>\n<P><EM><STRONG>PLEASE CLICK <A HREF=\"http://evanstonspace.com/faq\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">HERE</A> FOR A DETAILED FAQ.</STRONG></EM></P>\n<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0</STRONG>Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

Midnight to Close: Salsa/Video Music by DJ PRIETO   MUST RSVP NO LATER THEN 3PM (DAY OF THE EVENT)  Bio: Lisett Morales was born and raised in Havana, Cuba. Her strong and unique tone of voice instantly made her a distinguishable Artist at a very young age, for which her Father, Severino Morales, realized she was going to be a talented and successful singer. It was not until 1998 when Lisett arrived to Miami, that her Father\u2019s dreams came true. She believes her voice talented is something she got from her mother Nilda Robaina, a geography teacher who used to sing at home all the time so beautiful. She started her artist career in Miami singing traditional Cuban music (Son, Guaracha, Chachacha, Bolero Son) with the Septeto Ahi Na\u2019 Ma\u2019 and had the opportunity to sing and record two albums with them. In 2002 they released the album \u201cAhi Na\u2019 Ma\u2019 La Mulata del Sabor\u201d and in 2004 the album \u201cAhi Na\u2019 Ma Con La Pi\u00f1a Pela\u201d name of one of their hit songs A Maria le Gusta La Pi\u00f1a Pela'. This music group was an excellent beginning for her music career thanks to the great acceptation and support they had from their fans. One of the biggest events where they had the honor to play was in 2004 for the President of USA George W. Bush at The Miami Arena. Lisett Morales makes her Off-Broadway debut as an Actress with Celia (The Life and Music of Celia Cruz).

This album has been her passport to the world. Peru, Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Canada are few of the countries where the radio station\u2019s DJ promotes her music. Lisett is also an excellent song writer and she only hasn\u2019t written songs for herself but for different artist as Luis \"Papo\" Marquez, Sean Riva, Kevin Riva, Isidro Infante, La Kara'Bana & Juicy Juice.
