In that time, singer-songwriters/multi-instrumentalists Karin Bergquist and Linford Detweiler (who've been married for 22 years) have built a vivid, emotionally-charged body of work that has won them a deeply devoted following and critical acclaim.\nLike its predecessors, \u200bLove & Revelation\u200b showcases the pair's timeless songcraft and understated yet soulful delivery. Those qualities are prominent on such memorable new songs as \"Los Lunas,\" \"Let You Down,\" \"Broken Angels\" and \"Making Pictures,\" whose insistent melodies and striking lyrical imagery haunt the listener long after the music fades.\nThe 11-song \u200bLove & Revelation\u200b, which the rural Ohio-based duo and their \u201cBand of Sweethearts\u201d recorded with longtime engineer Ryan Freeland at his Stampede Origin studio in Culver City, CA, continues Over the Rhine's career-long embrace of its unmistakable creative values.\n\"Each record we've released is authentic to a particular time in our lives,\" Detweiler notes. \"They're all mile markers on a long road that beckoned to us in our youth. Karin did a lot of the heavy lifting on this record in terms of the songwriting and really set the tone for the project. We help edit each other's work, and it was so great to sit at the kitchen table together and let songs come fully into being. It's not always easy, but it is rewarding, and ultimately very intimate work. I'm so grateful for our musical connection at this point in our lives and marriage.\"\nAlthough the duo's usual producer, Joe Henry, was unavailable to work on the new album due to a writing sabbatical in Ireland, many of \u200bLove & Revelation\u2019\u200bs all-star cast of musicians originally came to Over the Rhine via Henry:Jay Bellerose, drums, percussion\nJennifer Condos, hollow-body bass\nGreg Leisz, electric guitar, pedal steel, mandolin\u00a0\nPatrick Warren, keyboards, string arrangements\nBradley Meinerding, electric guitar, mandolin\u00a0\nHenry's influence is also felt in \u200bLove & Revelation\u200b's title. Bergquist continues: \"Joe always used to sign off in his emails and letters with 'Love & Revelation, JH.' It was a little blessing he would offer\u2014his wish, I suppose, being that anyone who came into his circle would know love and be open to being surprised. The\u00a0phrase became important to us, and we asked Joe if we could use it for the name of the record. He quickly gave us his blessing.\"\nEven after three decades of record-making, Bergquist and Detweiler still find fulfillment and inspiration in the creative process. \"The poet Christina Rosetti has a poem that begins, \u200bDoes the road wind up hill all the way?,\u200b\" Bergquist explains, \"She assures us that it does indeed, until the very end, but there are surprising rewards along the way nonetheless. We don't know that it ever really gets easier. But we will say the actual recording of the songs is a joy, and is something that we just get caught up in. The lion's share of this record was recorded in just three days, with a sympathetic group of musicians leaning in together. It's something you can get high on for weeks. But writing songs, the mixing process and fine-tuning things toward the end\u2014it can be a bit harrowing as well.\"\"Priorities change as the years pass,\" Detweiler observes. \"There's a line in one of the new songs, 'Betting on the Muse,' \u200bThe fact that you still make me laugh is what I'm most proud of\u200b. That's probably the best definition of success we can come up with at the moment. Thank God we're still laughing.\"\n\"But honestly, there is a fair amount of grieving on this record too,\" Detweiler adds. \"We aren't kids anymore, and we've buried people we love over the years. Nobody gets out of this world alive.\u201d\n\"One song that I had been working on for years is 'Los Lunas,'\" Bergquist notes. \"It ended up being the first track on the record, and the narrator in the song states a simple fact at the outset: \u200bI cried all the way from Los Lunas to Santa Fe\u200b. We realized that we were grieving. And I think a lot of people are. Why are we grieving? We've lost loved ones. We've seen our friends struggling with loss\u2014the loss of a child, or a partner. We've seen friends and family members struggling with chronic illness, or a daunting cancer diagnosis. As Willie Nelson wrote in one of his recent songs, \u200bIt's not something you get over, it's just something you get through\u200b. A lot of these new songs are coming to terms with our realization that certain losses will be carried with us for the rest of our lives.\"\n\"We know a lot of people turn on the news and are in shock at what they are seeing,\" says Detweiler. \"Beneath that shock is grief. We are grieving the fact that we aren't quite sure who we are anymore as Americans. Things are shifting and being revealed.\u201d\"But then the record takes a turn,\" Bergquist points out. \"Some things haven't changed. We still believe in love and revelation. We still believe in meaningful work. We keep going, and with the darkness falling, we still find reason to dance.\"\nThat attitude is shared by Over the Rhine's audience, which continues to embrace the duo's music with a heartfelt intensity that transcends mere fandom.\"We think of the people who have found our music less as fans, and more as extended musical family,\" says Bergquist. \"We didn't necessarily plan it this way, but our music has been very effective at creating community. People who find our music tend to invite it into their big moments: falling in love, walking down the aisle, giving birth, decorating for Christmas... All the way through to the hardest stuff, like a period of extended illness, putting loved ones in the ground and saying goodbye.\"\nIndeed, every Memorial Day weekend, Bergquist and Detweiler host Nowhere Else Festival on their farm in Clinton County, Ohio, where they're in the process of transforming an historic 1870s barn into a performing arts center. The duo invites a variety of musicians, writers, filmmakers and visual artists to join them for a weekend of music, art and conversation. Those gatherings have been described as extended musical family reunions for the band and its fans.\"There are different questions a young artist can ask,\" Detweiler observes. \"One is, 'What must I do to be famous?,' which swings the door open to all manner of destructive forces from both within and without. Another question is, 'What must I do to make this sustainable, to practice a craft for the long haul, to continue to grow over the course of an entire lifetime?' The second question has always been far more interesting to us. And to make a career sustainable, we had to establish a fair bit of independence early on.\u201d\n\"We can, and will, reflect on the last 30 years of making music, and we'll lift a glass in 2019 to our 30th anniversary to be sure,\" says Bergquist. \"But what's most important and more interesting to us is to think about what's ahead: the next 30 years.\u201d\n\"Eventually we want to record much of our music in the barn, host concerts, workshops etc.,\" says Detweiler. \"Our big idea moving forward is: Wouldn't it be great to make music in front of a great live audience and then sleep in our own beds every now and then?\u201d\n\"For years people have been telling us that they find our songs healing,\" says Bergquist. \"Or they come to Nowhere Else Festival, and describe the weekend as 'healing.' It used to always surprise us. But in recent years we have experienced it ourselves. We always feel better when the music starts. We can feel our bodies change. We breathe easier. We begin to believe that all may be well in the end.\"\n\"Maybe the best thing we can do for someone who is struggling is just to let them know they're not alone,\" Detweiler adds. \"A good song can do that. So a\u00a0confession as simple as, I cried last night, I couldn't sleep, I'm struggling, and this is what it looks like today, can be incredibly powerful.\u201d\u00a0Karin concludes, \u201cWe are rhymers. And there is still so much music left to be made.\u201d\nWebsite\n\nFAQs\nPLEASE CLICK HERE FOR A DETAILED FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

How could it be otherwise? Tito Puente Jr. carries his father with him \u2013 imprinted on his physical being and locked in his soul. It\u2019s in his looks, his joy, and his music.   Tito, Jr. is on a passionate mission. The younger Puente is determined to nurture the musical legacy left by his father. He refuses to let his father become a distant memory. \u201cHe was just too vibrant, too exciting. There was magic in the music my father made. It made people happy all over the world.\u201d  He has found captive audiences who echo his passion. Crowds lured to a venue by the father are returning to see the son -- and to once again participate in the high voltage celebration that takes place on stage.  Tito Puente, Jr. has become an audience favorite in casinos, performing arts centers, symphony halls and jazz festivals worldwide, performing more than 300 shows over the past 5 years.   His 2004 album, \u201cIn My Father\u2019s Shoes\u201d featured the classic Puente titles and was spun into a BET Jazz television special of the same name.  He was seen in a tribute to his father\u2019s music on NBC\u2019s two hour special--\u201cThe Apollo at 70: A Hot Night in Harlem.\u201d He has also appeared on the ABC soap opera hit \u201cOne Life to Live\u201d in performance with his big band.  Symphony appearances include Dallas, San Antonio, Colorado, South Bend, and upcoming performances with the Palm Desert Symphony and the National Symphony Orchestra conducted by Marvin Hamlisch.  Tito, Jr.\u2019s new CD release, \u201cGot Mambo?\u201d is a mixture of the old and the new as he takes a musical departure into some powerful new music he can truly call his own. Guest artists Bobby Cruz and Hansel & Raul help make this a coming of age project for Puente, Jr. and the album is receiving heavy praise from Tropical and Latin Jazz critics alike.   Tito Jr. reveres the magnificent, lasting impact his father had on our musical lives. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t know anything about Latin music know my father and people always, always smile when they say my father\u2019s name,\u201d he confides. \u201cThat is a very special gift I have been given.\u201d   Tito, Jr. lives in South Florida and has two children, Miranda and Antonio.

His music initially took hold a decade ago, where praise from The Guardian, Time Out London, and The Sunday Times led to a major label record deal. He\u2019s toured internationally as an opening act for artists such as Jamie Cullum, Paul Carrack, and Goldfrapp, and he has shared the stage with a host of comedians including Will Ferrell, Reggie Watts, Paul Scheer, and Wyatt Cenac. His ability to transition seamlessly between both worlds has led to regular appearances on The Howard Stern Show and NPR\u2019s Ask Me Another. In 2017, he was an artist in residence at the prestigious Joe\u2019s Pub at The Public Theater in New York City. Velard has written music and lyrics for Pop acts, commercials and the Internet, including songs for UK sensation Olly Murs, Wix.com, New York Knicks, Buzzfeed, Audible and The New Republic. His work has been featured Mashable, The AV Club, and Nerdist. Velard\u2019s latest album, Fancy Words for Failure, was profiled in The Wall Street Journal.\u00a0\nWebsite\n\nFAQs\nPlease click here for a detailed FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

His music initially took hold a decade ago, where praise from The Guardian, Time Out London, and The Sunday Times led to a major label record deal.<BR> <BR>He\u2019s toured internationally as an opening act for artists such as Jamie Cullum, Paul Carrack, and Goldfrapp, and he has shared the stage with a host of comedians including Will Ferrell, Reggie Watts, Paul Scheer, and Wyatt Cenac. His ability to transition seamlessly between both worlds has led to regular appearances on The Howard Stern Show and NPR\u2019s Ask Me Another. In 2017, he was an artist in residence at the prestigious Joe\u2019s Pub at The Public Theater in New York City.<BR> <BR>Velard has written music and lyrics for Pop acts, commercials and the Internet, including songs for UK sensation Olly Murs, Wix.com, New York Knicks, Buzzfeed, Audible and The New Republic. His work has been featured Mashable, The AV Club, and Nerdist. Velard\u2019s latest album, Fancy Words for Failure, was profiled in The Wall Street Journal.\u00a0</P>\n<P><A HREF=\"https://julianvelard.nyc/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Website</A></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<H2><STRONG>FAQs</STRONG></H2>\n<P><STRONG>Please click <A HREF=\"http://evanstonspace.com/faq\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</A> for a detailed FAQ.</STRONG></P>\n<P><STRONG>Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0</STRONG>Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

Natural talent and the lure of a challenge drove him to be the best musician he could and discover his love for singing, songwriting and the upright bass. After attending college at North Texas State University, Scott moved to Nashville, where his life changed after meeting American music icon Ricky Skaggs and joining his Grammy winning band, Kentucky Thunder. He toured with Ricky for over five years, and in that time, first started writing songs on his upright bass.\nScott describes his experience, \u201cI started music as a bass player, but when it came to singing and writing songs, all my favorite writers played guitar or piano, and I just figured I had to as well. But while in Ricky Skaggs\u2019 band, I started performing '20/20 Vision' in the show, which opened with just the bass and my voice, and it was a revelation. I realized that this sound, this concept could work, and I honestly wondered why I hadn't had the courage to do it before. So I started writing songs on the bass. I tried to make the bass parts complete arrangements with harmony and rhythm, and weave my melodies between all that - the first song I wrote that way was \u201cFighting for the Wrong Side\u201d. And that\u2019s when the music became unique. Not for unique sake, but just because I was finally bringing all of my varied skills to the table and doing something that few others could, and it was where I felt I could give my best to the music.\u201d\n\u2028Himalayas is the culmination of that combination of musicality. Scott\u2019s songs have received honors or been featured in NPR\u2019S Tiny Desk Contest, the International Songwriting Competition, John Lennon Songwriting Contest, and American Songwriter Magazine\u2019s 30thAnniversary Contest, and he has had numerous cuts on other artists\u2019 albums. Scott was a showcase performer at 2018 Americana Music Festival, and has been featured on Lightning 100 radio\u2019s Nashville Sunday Night series. He is touring this fall as a featured artist on the Lauren Daigle \u201cLook Up Child\u201d tour, as well as the \u201cWin/Win\u201d tour with Matt Wertz and Jon McLaughlin.\n\u2028He has shared the stage with some of the greatest artists of modern music, such as: Alison Krauss, Barry Gibb of the BeeGees, Bruce Hornsby, Brad Paisley, Peter Frampton, Steven Curtis Chapman, Emmylou Harris, Dave Barnes, Ben Rector, and many more. He\u2019s currently touring in support of his September release, Himalayas, which was produced by himself, Charlie Peacock (The Civil Wars, The Lone Bellow) Gary Paczosa (Alison Krauss, Sarah Jarosz), and Shani Ghandi (Sarah Jarosz).\nWebsite\n\nFAQs\nPlease click here for a detailed FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

The rocking yet poignant title track explores his journey from addiction to sobriety and then musical recognition; he is a two-time 2017 Blues Music Award nominee. \u201cSecond chance at a first class life,\u201d he sings, recalling the hard times. The Texas-based musician smiles and continues, \u201cI grew up poor in St. Louis, and now I'm traveling the world to sing my songs.\u201d\nZito\u2019s star has been on the rise of late both solo and as a member of the Royal Southern Brotherhood, with bandmates Cyril Neville, Devon Allman, Charlie Wooton and Yonrico Scott.\nAs is fitting for a man with the word \u201cBlues\u201d tattooed across his picking hand, \u2018First Class Life\u2019 focuses squarely on blues with heart and chops to spare, not to mention wit and openness. The punchy \u201cTime For A Change\u201d conjures the tension in the world today while the exquisite Memphis-style song, \u201cThe World We Live In,\u201d which recalls BB King in its world-weariness. The electrified blues bounce of \u201cDying Day\u201d finds Zito swearing lifelong allegiance to his wife. \u201cOld Black Graveyard\u201d sets the scene of a bluesman\u2019s final resting place and its disrepair, along with some possible supernatural influences, with Zito\u2019s masterful slide guitar flourishes driving it home.\nYet the record\u2019s darker moments are offset by cuts like \u201cMama Don't Like No Wah Wah,\u201d the funky crash-bang-wallop gem written with Ruf labelmate Bernard Allison about the late legend Koko Taylor. \u201cBernard told me about his first gig as guitarist for Taylor,\u201d laughs Mike. \u201cKoko didn\u2019t like any effects on the guitar, she wanted it to sound natural. When Bernard made an attempt to use an effect on his guitar after playing with her for months, he got caught. \u2018Mama don't like no wah wah\u2019 is what he was told. That\u2019s a song to me!\u201d The two guitar slingers trade off, trying to one up each other atop a funky blues groove, including Allison pulling out his forbidden wah wah pedal. The tongue-in-cheek \u201cBack Problems\u201d is a showcase for Zito\u2019s wit as a songwriter.\nIn addition to the press and Blues Music Award love, Zito has earned from fellow artists. Anders Osborne says, \"I love Mike Zito! He's got that rare kinda voice that resonates in your soul. All his hardship, life experiences and kind heart oozes out of every note his sings. His guitar playing dances delicately between a contemporary blues virtuoso and an old fashion soul man. Mike continues to impress me with his straightforward and honest songwriting. His joy and grace shine through every record he makes. \"\nWebsite\n\nFAQs\nPlease click here for a detailed FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

THIS EVENT\nSo, here\u2019s what happened\u2026\u00a0 Slam Horse was working diligently, conducting top-secret research for the XIA.\u00a0 After running experiments for many months, he finally succeeded in opening up a time-space portal!\u00a0 Slam sent multiple teams of Pony Patrol Agents through the portal, and one-by-one they all disappeared.\u00a0 Over the next 22 months, he sent many XIA Agents through to investigate the situation.\u00a0 They also mysteriously disappeared.\u00a0 Slam Horse, himself, finally went through the portal to attempt a rescue mission, and he has not been seen since.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we need your help!\n\u00a0\nSlam was able to send back a single communication, and after that, we lost contact with him.\u00a0 Intelligence based on Slam\u2019s communiqu\u00e9 indicates the time-space portal leads to Mars, 4.8 billion years ago, when the red planet had water, and could sustain life.\u00a0 Intelligence analysts at the Xenomorph Intelligence Agency believe Slam and the Ponies are there, and that they are being held captive, like pets.\u00a0 They are likely being forced to perform their music for the amusement of their captors, on an island in the Elysium Sea, on Mars.\u00a0 Unfortunately, a hostile race of aliens has taken Mars over, and is terraforming it.\u00a0 Worst of all, the hostile aliens\u2019 next stop is believed to be the Earth, where intelligence indicates they plan to do the same thing here, draining the life out of our planet, and enslaving the human race!\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nYou will be traveling through a time-space portal to another planet, almost 5 billion years into the past, where you will land on ancient Mars!\u00a0 The portal exits to an island that is the tallest mountain in the entire galaxy!\u00a0 Isolated by thousands of miles of open ocean, and ransacked by space pirates, the entire mysterious island is an active volcano!\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nHere on Earth we measure time in terms of B.C.E. and A.C.E.\u00a0 The Martians, however, measure their time in terms of B.E. (before eruption) and A.E. (after eruption)!\u00a0 You don\u2019t want to get vaporized by a steam vent!\n\u00a0\nFans are cast as XIA Agents, who must go in undercover.\u00a0 Your cover story is that you are a Slam Horse fan who's going to an island-themed party to see Slam Horse performing live on Isle of Vulgaria, Mars.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nThe mountain-volcano-island known geologically as Elysium Mons, is home to the peace-loving Luxorian \u201caliens.\u201d\u00a0 (They\u2019re aliens to us, but to them, they\u2019re just Luxorians, of course).\u00a0 The beautiful Isle of Luxoria has been taken over by the invading Vulgarians.\u00a0 The Vulgarians renamed the island Isle of Vulgaria, and they are using this island as their base of operations while they terraform Mars.\u00a0 They are setting in motion events that will ultimately destroy the planet...unless some brave souls are courageous enough to step in and help!\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nYour secret mission is to: \n\nrescue Slam and the Ponies, \nsave the day for the indigenous inhabitants, the Luxorians, \ndefeat the Vulgarian overlords\u2019 agenda, \nsave Mars from becoming the barren\u00a0planet we know it as today, &\nprotect the Earth from suffering the same fate!\u00a0\n\nDon\u2019t worry, there are snacks ;-)\n\nAlong the way you\u2019ll meet the peaceful indigenous alien inhabitants known as the Luxorians.\u00a0 You\u2019ll probably also come face-to-face with the hostile alien overlords, the Vulgarians.\u00a0 You\u2019ll be bumping into fellow humans as well.\u00a0 They likely stumbled into a time-space wormhole some time ago, and will probably have been stranded on Mars for many generations by the time you get there.\u00a0 Those humans have been inbreeding the whole time, and are known as \u201cGenies,\u201d because their gene pool leaves them fit for little else other than providing comedy relief!\u00a0 You\u2019ll also be interacting with gorgeous Slam Pony Patrol Agents, and badass XIA Agents!\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nWe've deciphered the aliens' languages, social customs, manners of behavior, religious beliefs, and more.\u00a0 You will learn about them in your briefing.\u00a0 You will feel like you've gotten to know these beings.\n\u00a0\nPASSPORTS\nThe Far Out Trips travel agency is secretly run by the Xenomorph Intelligence Agency and the Global Bureau of Portals.\u00a0 Far Out Trips will book your vacation to ancient Mars for you, backstop your cover story, and will also provide you with your Intergalactic Passport.\u00a0 An undercover XIA Agent will issue Your IP (Intergalactic Passport) to you once you arrive at the venue.\u00a0 You will need to have your visa stamped at several different ports of entry while on Mars.\u00a0 You cannot engage in interdimensional travel without an Intergalactic Passport!\u00a0 If you have any questions, you may call Far Out Trips Travel Agency at 630-492-0154. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nMISSION BRIEFING/ REQUIRED SHUTTLE \nParking at the venue is limited to personnel only.\u00a0 Fans will park at the free parking lot at the Plainfield Public Library located at 15025 S Illinois St, Plainfield, IL 60544.\u00a0 A complimentary Slam Horse shuttle will pick you up at the free parking lot, and take you to the venue, which is less than a mile away, also in Plainfield, IL.\u00a0 (Due to the M.L.T., or, multi-layered time-space, the venue is actually located on ancient Mars, once you pass through the Time-Space Portal.)\u00a0 Exact details will be revealed to you once you have the proper security clearance (which simply requires that you purchase a ticket)!\u00a0\nIn addition to offering our esteemed guests convenience, the shuttle is also an important requirement.\u00a0 Once aboard the shuttle, an XIA Agent will brief you on your\u00a0\u201cmission\u201d en route to the venue.\u00a0 Afternoon shuttle pick-up times will be emailed to you after you have purchased your ticket(s).\u00a0 Your shuttle pick-up time will most likely fall between 2-4 p.m., depending upon to which group you are assigned.\u00a0 If you purchase more than one ticket on your order, all the people in your group will be placed in the same shuttle group whenever possible.\u00a0\nPlease note that the \u201cimmersion theater\u201d experience begins on the shuttle.\u00a0 You\u2019ll need to be aboard to receive your mission briefing.\u00a0 The briefing sets up the entire experience, reveals information, and gives you important physical clues, to help you navigate your way through the escape room, \u201chaunted house,\u201d & scavenger hunt.\u00a0 Even though the venue is less than a mile from the parking lot, the driver will take the scenic route, so that the XIA Agent will have the necessary 15 minutes or so to give you your briefing.\u00a0 You may enjoy the complimentary beverages aboard the shuttle, to spice up your party-journey, while you learn about what mysteries lie ahead!\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0ALIEN MONEY\nFood, beverages, and concert merchandise will be available at the venue for a donation.\u00a0 The venue (being on another planet) will obviously not accept Earth money, including U.S. Dollars.\u00a0 Once you pass through the Time-Space Portal, you will have the opportunity to do a money exchange.\u00a0 You will cash in your U.S. Dollars for Elysian Dongies.\u00a0 Dongies are the metal coin currency used by the pirates of the Elysium Sea, on Mars.\u00a0\nAfter the invading Vulgarian overlords made the indigenous Luxorians\u2019 currency illegal, pirate money arose as the main currency on-island.\u00a0 Gold coins are worth $10.\u00a0 Silver coins are $5.\u00a0 Bronze coins are $1.\u00a0 Luckily the exchange rate of USD to E>\u00a0is 1:1, and tends to remain fairly stable over time.\u00a0 You will exchange your money at the Interstellar Bank of Vulgaria.\u00a0 Only cash & credit cards are accepted to purchase Elysian Dongies.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\nFOOD AND DRINK\nThe venue\u2014The Penetralium, is located on the Isle of Vulgaria, in the Elysium Sea, about 3,000 miles west of Tharsis, on Mars, 4.8 billion years ago.\u00a0 The Penetralium Arena is located underground in the Labian Mines.\u00a0 The Penetralium includes two areas for concessions:\u00a0 The Pony Hole Cantina (in the Lower Labian Mines), and the Club 69 VIP Lounge (in the Upper Labian Mines).\u00a0\nAccording to intelligence, the Vulgarians were so taken with the beauty and exotic ways of the Ponies, that they named the concession area at the Penetralium Arena after them.\u00a0 They named it \u201cThe Pony Hole Cantina,\u201d in their reverence.\u00a0\nSlam Horse built the Club 69 VIP Lounge in case any humans came to Mars from the Earth, so they would have somewhere to hang out that was relatively free from aliens. \u00a0\u201cRelatively\u201d free being the operative word.\u00a0\nBe sure to purchase an upgraded ticket if you want VIP Lounge access! \u00a0\n\u00a0\nConcessions include gourmet island food and drinks, as well as stadium-style food and beverages.\u00a0 Food and drinks are available in the Pony Hole Cantina as well as in the Club 69 VIP Lounge.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nPony Shelly is our resident chef.\u00a0 She is known as the World\u2019s Horniest Chef.\u00a0 Pony Shelly loves food, and she loves making food for the people she loves!\u00a0 You will likely feel loved when you eat her food.\u00a0 Her gourmet creations have been described as \"an orgasm for your mouth.\"\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to explain, and incredible to experience.\u00a0 Her food is exciting & inspiring! \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0Pony Hole Cantina Offerings\u2026\n\u00a0\nOUR GOURMET ELIXIR: \u00a0THE PONY TAIL\nSlam and the Ponies along with some culinary specialists spent several months perfecting an original drink they developed just for this show.\u00a0 They crafted it with love until every single taste-tester on the team gave it a \u201c9\u201d or a \u201c10.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s an island cocktail called a\u00a0\u201cPony Tail,\u201d and it\u2019s delicious!\u00a0 Some of the ingredients are:\n\nDark rum, \nmango rum, \nbanana rum, \nimported Hawaiian macadamia nut liquor, \nblackberry brandy, \npineapple juice, \norange juice, \npomegranate juice,\nfreshly-squeezed lime juice, \ncoconut cream, &\na splash of Jamaican Appleton rum on top.\n\nThese are some of the ingredients that make this new island drink exciting for your tongue!\u00a0\nThe Pony Tail is served with multiple garnishes to titillate your senses:\n\nFruit:\u00a0 orange, maraschino cherry, pineapple, blackberry, & mango\nFlower:\u00a0 edible hibiscus & dianthus flowers\nMineral:\u00a0 edible gold flakes\nChef\u2019s signature garnish:\u00a0 a playful banana-dolphin \nServed with Hawaiian umbrella & bamboo straw in gold-rimmed glass!\nThe dry ice fog effect puts this mystical Martian drink over-the-top!\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Must try!!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0HUMANO GOURMET SANDWICH\nAlso in the Pony Hole Cantina, you may enjoy our gourmet \u201cHumano\u201d island sandwich.\u00a0 It\u2019s a classic Cubano with a twist.\u00a0 The aliens make this Cubano.\u00a0 The name \u201cHumano\u201d makes it sound a little suspicious\u2026 and, it\u2019s delicious nonetheless!\u00a0 \nIt includes:\n\nSmoked Pork, marinated in lime juice & cilantro,\ngrilled, marinated pineapple, \ndressed jicama,\nshredded cabbage and green apple with fennel,\nChef Pony Shelly\u2019s custom Cosmic Orgasm dip\u2026\nall served on fresh, homemade \u201cdill-dough\u201d bread (shaped suggestively)!\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0The aliens serve each \u201cHumano\u201d sandwich with a little sign on a spear, displaying names like, \u201cBob,\u201d \u201cSusan,\u201d or \u201cJeff.\u201d\u00a0 Those aren\u2019t the names of the people who ordered the sandwich.\u00a0 And those aren\u2019t the names of the people who made the sandwich.\u00a0 We\u2019re not sure who those people are.\u00a0 Come to think of it, many humans have become stranded on Mars, and have disappeared.\u00a0 But, the aliens reassure us that the names on the\u00a0\u201cHumanos\u201d are placed there in reverence of the human race, and the sacrifices they have made.\u00a0 It\u2019s probably nothing.\u00a0 Enjoy!\n\u00a0\nSNACKS\n\nSticky Fingers:\u00a0 ginger chicken fingers wrapped in bamboo shoots, served on a bamboo stick, with gourmet dipping sauce.\n\n\u00a0\nGOURMET DESSERTS\n\nTrojan Banana\nEruption Cake\nDecadent Chocolate

VIP Lounge.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nSeating for this show is limited! \u00a0Get your Tickets NOW! \u00a0\n\nTHE FLOW\nThe Shuttle Bus ride is where your briefing will take place.\u00a0 The Pre-Party starts as soon as the Shuttle drops you at the venue.\u00a0 You will need to use the Pre-Party to: \n\nget through the \u201cHaunted House;\u201d \nmake it through the Escape Room; \nfind the Time-Space Portal, and successfully pass through it to ancient Mars; &... \nonce there, navigate the Scavenger Hunt to find necessary clues to fulfill your undercover mission!\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0Remember:\u00a0 You\u2019re on an important mission, and the worlds are counting on you!\u00a0 No one will be able to stop you from having fun with it though\u2026despite the presence of the Vulgarian Sentries.\u00a0 There are no fun-police on Mars, per se.\u00a0 It\u2019s doubtful the Vulgarians even know what fun is.\u00a0 They\u2019re so serious all the time, making the indigenous Luxorians work in the Labian Mines, where they toil away, mining for cheese.\u00a0 Maybe you can teach the Vulgarians how to let their hair down, and crack a smile.\u00a0 Or, rather, grow some hair\u2026and a mouth. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0The Pre-Party will also feature:\n\nthemed characters, \nmusical performers, \ngourmet themed food & drinks available for a donation of Elysian Dongies, \nSlam Horse\u2019s \u201cpatented\u201d interactive immersion-theater experience, \nthemed alien games (optional), including futuristic games that electrically shock your fingers when you lose! (only for the bravest earthlings!)*\nand more!\u00a0\n\n*\u201dShock games\u201d are not suitable for individuals with epilepsy, pace maker, heart condition, high blood pressure, or those individuals sensitive to stress.\n\u00a0Those who haven\u2019t figured out how to get back to Earth by the end of the pre-party, will have to use the intermissions, and after-party, if necessary, to finish finding the necessary clues!\u00a0 There will be undercover agents ready to help you in your mission. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDRUM SOLO\nThe Ride Hard Experience will also include Slam Horse\u2019s

update you as soon as we acquire new intelligence.\u00a0 In the meantime, remain alert. \u00a0\n--Hugh Mann, Deputy Director of Xenomorph Intelligence", "html": "<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Slam

EVENT</P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>So, here\u2019s what happened\u2026\u00a0 Slam Horse was working diligently, conducting top-secret research for the XIA.\u00a0 After running experiments for many months, he finally succeeded in opening up a time-space portal!\u00a0 Slam sent multiple teams of Pony Patrol Agents through the portal, and one-by-one they all disappeared.\u00a0 Over the next 22 months, he sent many XIA Agents through to investigate the situation.\u00a0 They also mysteriously disappeared.\u00a0 Slam Horse, himself, finally went through the portal to attempt a rescue mission, and he has not been seen since.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we need your help!</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>Slam was able to send back a single communication, and after that, we lost contact with him.\u00a0 Intelligence based on Slam\u2019s communiqu\u00e9 indicates the time-space portal leads to Mars, 4.8 billion years ago, when the red planet had water, and could sustain life.\u00a0 Intelligence analysts at the Xenomorph Intelligence Agency believe Slam and the Ponies are there, and that they are being held captive, like pets.\u00a0 They are likely being forced to perform their music for the amusement of their captors, on an island in the Elysium Sea, on Mars.\u00a0 Unfortunately, a hostile race of aliens has taken Mars over, and is terraforming it.\u00a0 Worst of all, the hostile aliens\u2019 next stop is believed to be the Earth, where intelligence indicates they plan to do the same thing <I>here</I>, draining the life out of <I>our</I> planet, and enslaving the human race!\u00a0 </SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>\u00a0</SPAN></P>\n<P CLASS=\"MsoNormal\"><SPAN>You will be traveling through a

Vulgarians.\u00a0 The Vulgarians renamed the island Isle of Vulgaria, and they are using this island as their base of operations while they terraform Mars.\u00a0 They are setting in motion events that

The pair brings a high level of skill, confidence, ease and charm to each show gaining fans and followers wherever they perform. The music is jazz-based with acoustic guitars, harmonica and some percussion but draws upon many styles creating a show that grooves, soothes and tells stories.\nALSO FEATURINGRICHARD SMITH\nRichard started playing the guitar at age 5 and has never looked back. Focusing early on with the fingerstyle guitar of Chet Atkins and Jerry Reed, he began transcribing classical music, Jazz, the gypsy style of Django Reinhardt, bluegrass, ragtime and the blues to Sousa marches.

The pair brings a high level of skill, confidence, ease and charm to each show gaining fans and followers wherever they perform. The music is jazz-based with acoustic guitars, harmonica and some percussion but draws upon many styles creating a show that grooves, soothes and tells stories.<BR></P>\n<P><STRONG>ALSO FEATURING<BR></STRONG>RICHARD SMITH</P>\n<P><SPAN>Richard started playing the guitar at age 5 and has never looked back. Focusing early on with the fingerstyle guitar of Chet Atkins and Jerry Reed, he began transcribing classical music, Jazz, the gypsy style of Django Reinhardt, bluegrass, ragtime and the blues to Sousa marches. Now a seasoned performer in his forties with thousands of performances worldwide to his credit.\u00a0\u00a0In 2018, Richard performed in five continents... North and South America, Europe, Asia and Australia including performances with and alongside Tommy Emmanuel, Eric Clapton, Albert Lee, Dave Peacock, Martin Taylor, Brent Mason, Gary Brooker, Stuart Duncan, Bryan Sutton, Joe Brown, Ralph McTell and many others.</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN><A HREF=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCGGG9piAGY\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCGGG9piAGY</A></SPAN></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P><A HREF=\"https://www.richardsmithmusic.com/home\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www.richardsmithmusic.com/home</A></P>"}, "id": "61355355520", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/annie-sellick-and-pat-bergeson-with-special-guest-richard-smith-tickets-61355355520?aff=ebapi", "start": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2019-08-25T19:00:00", "utc": "2019-08-26T00:00:00Z"}, "end": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2019-08-25T21:30:00", "utc": "2019-08-26T02:30:00Z"}, "organization_id": "187899953579", "created": "2019-05-04T19:43:45Z", "changed": "2019-05-30T23:00:17Z", "published": "2019-05-04T20:06:14Z", "capacity": null, "capacity_is_custom": null, "status": "live", "currency": "USD", "listed": true, "shareable": true, "online_event": false, "tx_time_limit": 480, "hide_start_date": false, "hide_end_date": false, "locale": "en_US", "is_locked": false, "privacy_setting": "unlocked", "is_series": false, "is_series_parent": false, "inventory_type": "limited", "is_reserved_seating": false, "show_pick_a_seat": false, "show_seatmap_thumbnail": false, "show_colors_in_seatmap_thumbnail": false, "source": "create_2.0", "is_free": false, "version": "3.0.0", "summary": "The Venue is excited to present...\u00a0Annie Sellick and Pat Bergeson with special guest Richard Smith\nFor more information about The Venue, ple", "logo_id": "61701347", "organizer_id": "19126475647", "venue_id": "32014942", "category_id": "103", "subcategory_id": "3004", "format_id": "6", "resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/events/61355355520/", "is_externally_ticketed": false, "music_properties": {"resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/events/61355355520/music_properties/", "age_restriction": null, "presented_by": null, "door_time": null}, "ticket_availability": {"has_available_tickets": true, "minimum_ticket_price": {"currency": "USD", "value": 1500, "major_value": "15.00", "display": "15.00 USD"}, "maximum_ticket_price": {"currency": "USD", "value": 2500, "major_value": "25.00", "display": "25.00 USD"}, "is_sold_out": false, "start_sales_date": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2019-05-03T12:35:00", "utc": "2019-05-03T17:35:00Z"}, "waitlist_available": false}, "format": {"resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/formats/6/", "id": "6", "name": "Concert or Performance", "name_localized": "Concert or Performance", "short_name": "Performance", "short_name_localized": "Performance"}, "venue": {"address": {"address_1": "21 S Broadway Ave", "address_2": null, "city": "Aurora", "region": "IL", "postal_code": "60505", "country": "US", "latitude": "41.75675469999999", "longitude": "-88.3138702", "localized_address_display": "21 S Broadway Ave, Aurora, IL 60505", "localized_area_display": "Aurora, IL", "localized_multi_line_address_display": ["21 S Broadway Ave", "Aurora, IL 60505"]}, "resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/venues/32014942/", "id": "32014942", "age_restriction": null, "capacity": null, "name": "The Venue", "latitude": "41.75675469999999", "longitude": "-88.3138702"}, "basic_inventory_info": {"has_ticket_classes": true, "has_inventory_tiers": false, "has_ticket_rules": false, "has_add_ons": false, "has_donations": false}, "bookmark_info": {"bookmarked": false}, "logo": {"crop_mask": {"top_left": {"x": 0, "y": 0}, "width": 2160, "height": 1080}, "original": {"url": "https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F61701347%2F187899953579%2F1%2Foriginal.20190504-194812?auto=compress&s=0edd26a844f41b22a4d5b8c8c3e8459f", "width": 2160, "height": 1080}, "id": "61701347", "url": "https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F61701347%2F187899953579%2F1%2Foriginal.20190504-194812?h=200&w=450&auto=compress&rect=0%2C0%2C2160%2C1080&s=ad712c8cc217b532cd4734ec2eb7a3d5", "aspect_ratio": "2", "edge_color": null, "edge_color_set": true}}, {"name": {"text": "Kyle Flens with Jesse Langen & Katie Schoepflin Jimoh", "html": "Kyle Flens with Jesse Langen &amp;
