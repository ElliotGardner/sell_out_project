His singular vision, evocative lyrics, and aptitude for catchy, dense songwriting has placed him firmly among the ranks of modern icons like Bill Callahan, Kurt Vile, Sharon Van Etten, Will Oldham, and Jeff Tweedy. Each Morby record possesses its own unique persona and explores intriguing themes and fertile terrain through shifting, focused textures and dexterous, dedicated skill. And now, with the lavish, resplendent, career-best double LP Oh My God, Morby delivers a grandiose director\u2019s cut of his biggest statement to date, epic in scope as well as sound.Throughout his past work, Morby has noticed the ubiquity of an apparent religious theme. Though not identifying as \u201creligious\u201d, Morby\u2014the globetrotting son of Kansas City who has made music while living on both coasts before recently returning to his Midwestern stomping grounds\u2014recognizes in himself a somewhat spiritual being with a secular attitude towards the soulful. And so, in an effort to tackle that notion head-on and once-and-for-all, he sat down in his form of church\u2014on planes and in beds\u2014and wrote what would become his first true concept album. \u201cThis one feels full circle, my most realized record yet,\u201d says Morby. \u201cIt\u2019s a cohesive piece; all the songs fit under the umbrella of this weird religious theme. I was able to write and record the album I wanted to make. It\u2019s one of those marks of a life: this is why I slept on floors for seven years. I\u2019ve now gotten the keys to my own little kingdom, and I\u2019m devoting so much of my life to music that I just want to keep it interesting.\u201dMorby admits he has viewed the world through a skewed spiritual lens his entire life. As a kid he was told by his working-class parents that he was a Methodist, though the family rarely if ever made good on that claim come Sunday, and he saw fire-and-brimstone billboards on Kansas roadways with the aim of scaring heathens straight. Despite his ignorance and indifference, religion seemed to be everywhere, and as Morby grew as a musician\u2014playing bass for Woods, fronting The Babies, and with his solo career\u2014he embraced its influence with his work. In 2016, on the heels of a trio of critically-acclaimed albums, he wrote the protest song \u201cBeautiful Strangers\u201d about the devastating world events of that year, and in it he inserted multiple \u201coh my god\u201ds as pleas of desperation. The song became his most celebrated work to date and the phrase became a mantra for Morby, inspiring him to weave the exclamation conceptually into the fabric of an entire album. In effect, he sought to highlight how that immortal turn of phrase embodies so much of our relationship with the sacred and profane\u2014how religion is all around us, always, and that by simply uttering an OMG we enforce its ubiquity and ability to endure while humanizing its reach.\u201cReligion is around all of us,\u201d Morby says. \u201cIt\u2019s a universal language and there is profound beauty in it. I\u2019ve found it a useful tool within songwriting, as it\u2019s something everyone can relate to on some level. There are religious themes or imagery in a lot of what I\u2019ve done, so I wanted to get all of that out and speak only that language for a whole record. It\u2019s not a born-again thing; it\u2019s more that \u2018oh my god\u2019 is such a profound statement we all use multiple times a day and means so many different things. It\u2019s not about an actual god but a perceived one, and it\u2019s an outsider\u2019s view of the human experience in terms of religion.\u201dIn January 2017, preceding the release of his fourth solo record City Music, Morby went into producer Sam Cohen\u2019s Brooklyn studio for four days to record a handful of material written with his usual folk-meets-lo-fi-electric-guitar sound in mind. Cohen, with whom Morby made his 2016 breakthrough Singing Saw, had started recording the new songs with a business-as-usual mentality when on the third day he was struck with an idea: Rather than create what was becoming Singing Saw: Part 2, what if they stripped everything back and instead of the entire Morby rock palette used only a few colors at a time, focusing on Morby as hyper-literate singer instead of guitar-slinging troubadour?\u201cSam suggested that we make songs that sound like sonic pop-art that only have a few colors, like a Keith Haring piece,\u201d Morby says. \u201cMy other records had tons of colors, so we decided to keep this stark, like a painting that\u2019s black-and-white with one vibrant blue. We went back to the drawing board and thought about what we wanted to do conceptually across an entire piece. And for the first time I could do exactly what I wanted, as I had time and the ability to get everything precise. Sam encouraged me to let my lyrics sit on top of everything else, and that discovery and the confidence that came with making my fifth record helped me realize the new direction was exactly where we needed to be. We opened it up completely and set out to make something in its own universe.\u201dOver the remaining day-and-a-half, Morby and Cohen recorded new versions of four songs\u2014\u201cOh My God,\u201d \u201cNo Halo,\u201d \u201cSavannah,\u201d and \u201cNothing Sacred/All Things Wild,\u201d the latter becoming a mission statement for the new sound and featuring Morby singing, Cohen playing a subtle organ part, and Morby\u2019s drummer Nick Kinsey on congas. Breaking the songs down into their separate parts served Morby\u2019s religious theme perfectly, as did the blueprint of \u201cBeautiful Strangers,\u201d a song that would serve as a skeleton key of sorts for everything that was to come. Over the course of 2017, he wrote an album\u2019s worth of songs modeled after \u201cStrangers\u201d while on tour.As Morby jetted around the world playing shows, he came to realize that all that air travel was making its way into his music, too. He had always used his time in the sky to work on songs and listen to demos he had recorded, but he began noticing an aero-dynamic emerging in his lyrics as well. \u201cFlying can be something of a religious experience for many people, myself included,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s unnatural, and it can be so scary being that high up\u2014a few big bumps can even make an atheist pray. You\u2019re anxious as you take off and thinking about death, then you level off and suddenly you\u2019re in this kingdom above the clouds. There\u2019s a holy feeling, and a big part of the record\u2019s theme is being above the weather. The first song, \u2018Oh My God,\u2019 starts with chaotic hammering on a piano and then smooths out with a choir singing; it\u2019s meant to mimic how I feel on an airplane.\u201dAll that flying also meant Morby was sleeping in a new place each night, a situation he also learned to embrace creatively\u2014most of Oh My God\u2019s songs were written from beds. Morby typically starts and ends each day by playing guitar or writing songs while under the covers, a practice that mimics prayer in myriad ways. \u201cThere\u2019s something sacred about working from bed,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s where you make love and where you dream. I always write just before I go to sleep and right when I wake up. It\u2019s where I can access that feeling of dreams. Any bed is always a sanctuary, but my bed at home is the Holy Grail.\u201dMorby sought to represent these sentiments visually for the release of Oh My God. In addition to using a portrait of him reclining in his own fluffy-white bed at home in Kansas City on the album cover, he also worked with the filmmaker Chris Good on a short film to accompany the release. The film stars Morby as he wanders through a dream-like series of encounters\u2014on planes, in cars, in a diner, at home in his back yard\u2014and presents a Gondry-esque vision of the album and its holy mood.Meanwhile, in January of 2018, a full year after their initial session, Morby and Cohen returned to the studio together to complete the album\u2019s recording. They fine-tuned the rollicking opening trio\u2014starting with the title track, then first single \u201cNo Halo,\u201d and \u201cNothing Sacred/All is Wild\u201d\u2014 and played with various styles and techniques throughout. The ethereal \u201cCongratulations\u201d was written in a dream, a first for Morby. (\u201cSomeone had been singing the chorus to me over and over, and I woke up in the morning and walked to my piano and wrote it then and there.\u201d) \u201cSeven Devils\u201d features a ripping guitar solo by Morby\u2019s bandmate Meg Duffy that evokes a distorted hellfire, and \u201cPiss River\u201d is a stream-of-consciousness, poetic and profound tune featuring harp played by Morby\u2019s friend Mary Lattimore while the singer has a call-and-response conversation with himself. Saxophone duties throughout the record were handled largely by Cochemea Gastelum, and a seven-member choir appears as well. Morby directed Cohen in the creation of a track called \u201cStorm (Beneath the Weather),\u201d a 90-second ambient instrumental piece made with synthesizers to mimic what it can feel like under the clouds. \u201cAbove the weather, you\u2019re safe and nothing can get to you; it\u2019s heavenly, like you achieved peace,\u201d Morby says. \u201cBelow that you\u2019re subject to the insanity of humanity, or Mother Nature. I wanted a weird, atonal sound on the record to represent a storm, which feels in-line with the pop-art idea.\u201d\u201cHail Mary\u201d may be the album\u2019s grandest moment and is recognizable as one of the few guitar-driven songs that hearkens back to his previous work. Its heavy scope is still apparent despite the fact that Morby and Cohen edited it down from its original 15-minute-long, multiple-verse version into a concise five minutes and three verses. And as the final song, \u201cO Behold,\u201d makes a familiar, just-in-case farewell from an airplane seat (\u201cIf the plane\u2019s on fire/know I love you\u201d), the listener can sense the credits rolling as the clouds begin to break, grips loosen, and the kingdom comes into view. At 14 tracks and four sides, Oh My God is an actualized concept album with a contemporary feel that is sure to find itself on the shelf next to classic double-LPs like Blonde on Blonde, Exile on Main St, London Calling, and Zen Arcade with its maker planted firmly in a window seat at the front of the plane. Morby has graduated from the DIY beginnings and warehouse shows of his early days to become an admired, impassioned auteur who retains firm control of his vision as his stages only continue to grow. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d says Morby, \u201cthe only thing I don\u2019t want is to be bored. If someone wants to get in my face about writing a non-religious religious record? Thank god. That\u2019s all I gotta say.\u201d", "html": "<P><STRONG>KEVIN MORBY</STRONG></P><P>\ufeffwith Sam Cohen</P><P><A HREF=\"https://www.facebook.com/kevinrobertmorby\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Facebook</A>\u00a0I\u00a0<A HREF=\"https://twitter.com/kevinmorby\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Twitter</A>\u00a0I<A HREF=\"https://www.instagram.com/kevinmorby/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">\u00a0Instagram</A></P><P><STRONG>About the Show:</STRONG></P><P><EM>Doors 7:30pm / Show 8:30pm</EM></P><P>With his four acclaimed solo albums and myriad records of various collaboration, Kevin Morby has become a true musical auteur. His singular vision, evocative lyrics, and aptitude for catchy, dense songwriting has placed him firmly among the ranks of modern icons like Bill Callahan, Kurt Vile, Sharon Van Etten, Will Oldham, and Jeff Tweedy. Each Morby record possesses its own unique persona and explores intriguing themes and fertile terrain through shifting, focused textures and dexterous, dedicated skill. And now, with the lavish, resplendent, career-best double LP Oh My God, Morby delivers a grandiose director\u2019s cut of his biggest statement to date, epic in scope as well as sound.</P><P>Throughout his past work, Morby has noticed the ubiquity of an apparent religious theme. Though not identifying as \u201creligious\u201d, Morby\u2014the globetrotting son of Kansas City who has made music while living on both coasts before recently returning to his Midwestern stomping grounds\u2014recognizes in himself a somewhat spiritual being with a secular attitude towards the soulful. And so, in an effort to tackle that notion head-on and once-and-for-all, he sat down in his form of church\u2014on planes and in beds\u2014and wrote what would become his first true concept album. \u201cThis one feels full circle, my most realized record yet,\u201d says Morby. \u201cIt\u2019s a cohesive piece; all the songs fit under the umbrella of this weird religious theme. I was able to write and record the album I wanted to make. It\u2019s one of those marks of a life: this is why I slept on floors for seven years. I\u2019ve now gotten the keys to my own little kingdom, and I\u2019m devoting so much of my life to music that I just want to keep it interesting.\u201d</P><P>Morby admits he has viewed the world through a skewed spiritual lens his entire life. As a kid he was told by his working-class parents that he was a Methodist, though the family rarely if ever made good on that claim come Sunday, and he saw fire-and-brimstone billboards on Kansas roadways with the aim of scaring heathens straight. Despite his ignorance and indifference, religion seemed to be everywhere, and as Morby grew as a musician\u2014playing bass for Woods, fronting The Babies, and with his solo career\u2014he embraced its influence with his work. In 2016, on the heels of a trio of critically-acclaimed albums, he wrote the protest song \u201cBeautiful Strangers\u201d about the devastating world events of that year, and in it he inserted multiple \u201coh my god\u201ds as pleas of desperation. The song became his most celebrated work to date and the phrase became a mantra for Morby, inspiring him to weave the exclamation conceptually into the fabric of an entire album. In effect, he sought to highlight how that immortal turn of phrase embodies so much of our relationship with the sacred and profane\u2014how religion is all around us, always, and that by simply uttering an OMG we enforce its ubiquity and ability to endure while humanizing its reach.</P><P>\u201cReligion is around all of us,\u201d Morby says. \u201cIt\u2019s a universal language and there is profound beauty in it. I\u2019ve found it a useful tool within songwriting, as it\u2019s something everyone can relate to on some level. There are religious themes or imagery in a lot of what I\u2019ve done, so I wanted to get all of that out and speak only that language for a whole record.

THE ARTIST\n\u201cIt\u2019s a grown-up record,\u201d\u00a0Rhett\u00a0Miller says\u00a0of his extraordinary new album, The Dreamer. \u201cIt takes a long time to feel the confidence to step up and be the boss. I finally feel like I\u2019m there.\u201d\nRhett Miller has made a number of fine solo albums over his long, illustrious career, but none have felt quite as exemplary as The Dreamer. A collection of \u201csimple American songs and instrumentation,\u201d the album marks the second release on Miller\u2019s own Maximum Sunshine Records as well as the singer/songwriter\u2019s first foray into self-production. Sparsely arranged but animated with unrefined energy and emotion, songs like \u201cOut Of Love\u201d and \u201cSwimmin\u2019 In Sunshine\u201d join together elements of classic country, indie folk, and chamber pop, bridging the space between Miller\u2019s harder rocking work with the Old 97\u2019s and the inventive complexity of his brilliant solo career.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky thing,\u201d Miller says, \u201cmaking a solo career work simultaneously with a band. On the first solo records, I made a real point to differentiate them sonically from what the Old 97\u2019s do. I don\u2019t feel so defensive about it anymore. I can make solo records without feeling like I have to walk on eggshells for anybody.\u201d\nDespite the Old 97\u2019s prolifically in recent years \u2013 including five studio albums over the last decade \u2013 Miller found himself with a cache of material that didn\u2019t necessarily work within the rather ornery confines of the band. The songs all had a common thread which marked them as too temperate for the 97\u2019s and yet more traditional roots-rock than anything Miller had done on prior solo records.\n\u201cI love to write songs,\u201d Miller says. \u201cI love words and I love the stories you can tell in three minutes. This stack of songs seemed so natural and organic and I just wanted to play \u2018em.\u201d\nMiller decided to take an appropriately naturalistic approach towards the songs by producing them on his own. Having previously teamed with such top studio hands as George Drakoulias and longtime collaborator Jon Brion, he felt sure that he had the requisite chops to stand behind the helm of his own sessions.\n\u201cI kept explaining to people \u2013 management, the labels, the other musicians \u2013 what I hear and what I want to create,\u201d Miller says, \u201cand it occurred to me, \u2018Why am I depending on somebody else to realize the vision that I have when I could just as easily bring it to fruition myself?\u2019\u201d\nIn September 2011, Miller set to work at Dreamland Studios in pastoral West Hurley, New York, just south of Woodstock. His first move as a producer was to surround himself with \u201cpeople that take care of their own business, that bring their own brilliance to the table.\u201d With that in mind, Miller assembled a top flight team comprised of engineer Kevin McMahon (Real Estate, Titus Andronicus) and his longtime road band, The Serial Lady Killers \u2013 guitarist Tommy Borscheid, bassist Greg Beshers, and drummer Angela Webster \u2013 as well as a roster of guest players including pedal steel guitarist Rich Hinman (Ben Kweller, Matt Keating), keyboardist Joe McGinty (Nada Surf, Stew & The Negro Problem), and Miller\u2019s upstate NY neighbor, legendary percussionist Jerry Marotta (Peter Gabriel, Hall & Oates).\nHaving worked together since touring behind 2006\u2019s The Believer, the core band\u2019s simpatico connection helped streamline Miller\u2019s first venture into production. Their tacit communication allowed him to track much of the record completely live, invigorating the material with freewheeling vibrancy and high spirits.\n\u201cIt was just natural and easy,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody got along so well. The sessions weren\u2019t terribly long because we weren\u2019t going crazy with overdubs, we weren\u2019t trying to make anything overly perfect, so it went more quickly than any record I\u2019d ever been a part of. The only downside was that we were having so much fun, it seemed like it ended too soon.\u201d\nWhile Miller\u2019s initial goal had been to follow last year\u2019s self-released collection of covers, The Interpreter: Live At Largo, with a similarly stripped-down sound, it became evident these new songs warranted more of \u201ca backbone.\u201d He adopted an effervescent pop/rock approach akin to such current fave combos as Dawes, David Wax Museum and The Head and The Heart, surrounding his own acoustic guitar and vocals with lilting arrangements and an array of female harmonies. Among the talented women adding their voices to the proceedings are Rachael Yamagata, Heather Robb (of NYC-based folk-pop combo, The Spring Standards), and the great Rosanne Cash, who is featured on the co-written duet, \u201cAs Close As I Came To Being Right.\u201d Recording vocals for the latter track stands out as a particular highlight for Miller, who is justifiably jubilant at how perfectly he and Cash meshed.\n\u201cAs soon as we finished, we looked at each other and went, \u2018Oh my god, we really click,\u2019\u201d Miller says. \u201cSometimes you can have two voices and they don\u2019t necessarily go that well together. But she and I? Ours do.\u201d\nTeaming with Cash prompted Miller to \u201cstretch his wings\u201d via more collaborations, including songwriting partnerships with Jude Cole (\u201cI\u2019ll Try To\u201d) and Ben Kweller, who lent his distinctive style to the buoyant album opener, \u201cLost Without You.\u201d\n\u201cBen is such a positive guy,\u201d Miller says, \u201csuch a cheerleader. Getting to write with him was really fun. That song sets the tone for the whole record \u2013 there\u2019s a lot going on but it\u2019s still very simple. Straightforward folk music with a bunch of words and a good backbeat.\u201d\nThe earthy country pop of The Dreamer is ideally matched by the plaintive characterizations and the nuanced craftsmanship of a master tunesmith. Having loosely structured the album to create a somewhat illusory impression of loss, disconnection, and eventual redemption, Miller consciously infused The Dreamer with a subtle sense of the unconscious.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very dreamlike quality to what\u2019s going on in these songs,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a sonic quality, of gently loping rhythms, and all these lyrics that are realistic but somewhat disjointed.\u201d\nThose off-kilter observations distinguish such songs as \u201cOut of Love,\u201d which was inspired by the big beats blaring in the breakfast room of a hipster boutique hotel but ultimately morphed into Miller\u2019s \u201canswer to what a hit pop song would sound like in my perfect world.\u201d Elsewhere, \u201cPicture This\u201d serves as the album\u2019s tender heart. Co-written with the aforementioned Spring Standards \u2013 whose 2008 EP he co-produced \u2013 the track expertly exemplifies the album\u2019s bucolic soulfulness and spirit.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a song about growing up, getting married, having a couple of kids, and how unlikely the whole thing seems,\u201d Miller says. \u201cThey had written some really sweet lyrics, then I brought the value of my experience with regards to that specific situation and we were able to come up with this song together.\u201d\nA similar merging of sagacity and ingenuousness can be said to sum up The Dreamer, its smart, skilled songwriting balanced and brought to life by a playful spontaneity and its creator\u2019s hard-earned confidence. Having taken the reins into his own hands, Rhett Miller has crafted what feels like a milestone in his unquestionably robust oeuvre, a definitive portrait of the artist at his autonomous best.\nWebsite\n\nANTHONY D'AMATO\nProduced by Mike Mogis (Bright Eyes, First Aid Kit) and recorded with an Omaha all-star team of musicians including Conor Oberst and members of Bright Eyes, The Faint, and Cursive, \u2018Cold Snap\u2019 is Anthony D\u2019Amato\u2019s most ambitious, incisive, and sophisticated collection yet, with a larger-than-life sound propelled by dual drummers, explosive guitars, infectious hooks, and erudite lyrics. Written primarily during a touring hiatus forced by a broken finger, the songs explore the schisms between perception and reality, projection and truth, who we are and how we\u2019re seen.\nThe record follows D\u2019Amato\u2019s 2014 New West debut, \u2018The Shipwreck From The Shore,\u2019 which was inspired in part by his time studying with the Pulitzer Prize-winning Irish poet Paul Muldoon and earned raves on both sides of the pond, with NPR lauding that \u201che writes in the tradition of Bruce Springsteen or Josh Ritter\u201d and Uncut proclaiming that his songwriting \u201cechoes with early Bob Dylan.\u201d USA Today declared that the album \u201cstrikes every right note,\u201d SPIN praised the way he \u201cturns heartbreak into cheery folk,\u201d and Entertainment Weekly said the music \u201ccalls to mind Simon & Garfunkel\u2019s more amped-up moments.\u201d Songs from the record collectively cracked more than two million plays on Spotify and turned up on ABC\u2019s hit series Nashville, while the album earned additional love everywhere from the New York Times and WSJ to NY Mag and Billboard. D\u2019Amato hit the road hard for a year straight to promote the album, touring on three continents and sharing bills with Ben Folds, Josh Ritter, Shawn Colvin, Rhett Miller, Justin Townes Earle, Bleachers, and more along the way.\n\nFAQs\nPLEASE CLICK HERE FOR A DETAILED FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.
