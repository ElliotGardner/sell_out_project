With the expansive library of all the music of the world from every time period at our fingertips, creative artists seem to be more and more liberated from the archaic mentality of being pigeonholed into one genre or demographic. Mike Love is at the forefront of this movement. With a foundation rooted in the spirituality and message-based music of Reggae and Rastafari, he blends the sounds of progressive and classic rock, pop, R & B, soul, blues, flamenco, jazz and so much more. Healing is at the core of his music. With ever evolving live performances, Love keeps his organically grown fanbase returning again and again to witness the evolution of tried and true fan favorites, and the ever-expanding repertoire of new music that is constantly surfacing. Fans often leave live performances remarking about how they have just been to church, or had a bad day turned around.\nBorn and raised on the island of O'ahu, Hawai'i, Love was brought up in an environment surrounded by musical influence and the inspiring natural landscape of his island home. Forging a deep connection with nature, his message of returning to a more natural and spiritually grounded way of living was solidified at an early age. Growing up under the musical guidance of his father and grandfather, both composers, as well as his steel pan instructor Frank Leto and piano teacher Beth Uale, Mike's natural musical instincts towards melody and harmony were shaped and deepened. Mike started playing the guitar at age 15 and played in multiple bands throughout his teenage years, playing his first live gig with a band at age 16.\nIt wasn't until he joined forces with local musicians Tavana, Brad Watanabe (currently of The Green) and longtime collaborator and current drummer Sam \"Ites\" Gonsalves to form the band Melodious Solutions, that his musical vision started to take shape. Furthering his talents as a composer/lyricist and arranger, Love subsequently fronted the 10-piece band Dubkonscious for a few years, entering into his first studio experience as producer as well on the band's album \"At the Foot of the Mountain\".\nIn 2008, he started a solo weekly residence, performing at a local Irish Pub on Mondays. During his long four-hour sets there, he developed a unique one-man-band style, using looping, multiple instruments, and an array of different vocal techniques and musical styles. As his creativity and delivery in a solo format blossomed, so did his audiences. Slowly and organically, this became his main project and his solo career was born. In December of 2012, Love released his first solo album, the critically acclaimed fan favorite \"The Change I'm Seeking\". With instant classics like \"Permanent Holiday\", \"Barbershop\", and \"Human Race\", his fanbase rapidly grew, worldwide, with the success of a handful of viral videos on YouTube. Love also delved into more passionate subjects on the album, with tracks like \"Earthlings\" exhibiting his desire to \"Veganize\" the world and wake people up to the injustices of animal cruelty, and \"No More War\", a call to \"bring the troops back home\" from these \"wars that no one really wants\". It was clear that finally Love had found his voice and was ready to share his music with the world.\nHe began touring that year with best friend and musical soul-mate Paula Fuga, playing shows to enthusiatic crowds in the western U.S. supporting bands like Groundation and Nahko and Medicine for the People. As the buzz spread, so did the reach of Mike and his band. The next year brought them all over the U.S. playing club shows and festivals alike. Love supported Trevor Hall and Xavier Rudd on major tours throughout the eastern U.S. and Canada, winning over many fans in the grassroots style he had become accustomed to. You'll often catch Mike saying \"I just keep playing the music, and this thing just keeps growing. It has a life of its own and I'm just grateful for it.\" International touring soon followed, with warm and enthusiastic receptions across Europe, Central America, Australia, Polynesia and more. Throughout it all, Love has remained humble, citing the healing power of the music that comes from a larger place as the sole reason this all has been possible.\nWith the release of his second album \"Love Will Find a Way\" and follow-up companion album \"Love Overflowing\" featuring sing-along tunes like \"I Love You\" and \"No Regrets\", he solidified the bond with his fans and exhibited the evolution that lovers of his music had come to expect. Returning to the studio with road-tested material and a more intimate connection with a worldwide audience had obviously resulted in a more refined and focused sound and ideology.\nCurrently, he has formed a super-band, hand-picked from all of the top musicians he's worked with over the years, dubbed aptly, Mike Love and the Full Circle. They have honed their skills and come together as a tight unit at home on O'ahu and have now begun to tour, taking Love's music to even greater heights. As they prepare to return to the studio in 2018, we can anticipate that the new album they are concocting will be the most dynamic, heartfelt and spirited offering yet. In the years to come we can only expect more growth, more innovation, and of course, more Love.\nWebsite\n\nFAQs\nPLEASE CLICK\u00a0HERE\u00a0FOR A MORE DETAILED FAQ.\u00a0\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

The album showcases WWR\u2019s growth as songwriters and musicians. Produced by Tim Carbone of Railroad Earth, the album features an array of special guests such as Andy Hall on dobro (Infamous Stringdusters), Andy Thorn on banjo (Leftover Salmon), Grammy Award winner John Macy on pedal steel and Bill McKay on piano. The Colorado-bred quintet combines the elements of mandolin, fiddle, acoustic guitar, upright bass, drums and vocals to explore the musical boundaries of multiple genres and to fuel their own mixture of original music and innovative cover song interpretations.

In\u00a0Le Barbier, Count Almaviva, with substantial help from Figaro, wooed and won the lovely Rosine away from her crusty old ward and would-be husband, Dr. Bartholo. In\u00a0The Marriage of Figaro, Beaumarchais continued their story. The Count has married Rosine but their marriage has gone sour because of his philandering. Figaro has quit barbering and is now the Count\u2019s major-domo. He is engaged to Suzanne, who is Countess Rosine\u2019s maid \u2014 and the Count\u2019s intended conquest. Old Bartholo is back to seek revenge on Figaro for taking Rosine away from him, with the help of the slimy music-master, Don Bazile.

Sly, slinky, and deeply soulful, the aptly entitled new release finds this Big Easy funk savant \u2013 a virtuosic keyboardist, profoundly expressive vocalist, and quite distinctive songwriter \u2013 in peak form on a set of all-original material. Like GoGo Juice, Dyna-Mite was co-produced by Cleary and the prolific John Porter, whose eclectic, behind-the-board credits include albums by Ryan Adams, Billy Bragg, Elvis Costello, B.B. King, Buddy Guy, R.L. Burnside, Taj Mahal, and the late Hammond B-3 master Jimmy Smith.\nDyna-Mite was recorded in several studios around New Orleans, including Cleary\u2019s in-home facility, with accompaniment by a host of the Crescent City\u2019s A-list musicians. These ace co-conspirators include the Lettuce Horns, guitarists Leo Nocentelli (formerly of The Meters) and Shane Theriot, the rhythm sections of drummers Jamison Ross and A.J. Hall, bassists Calvin Turner and Cornell Williams, and the multi-instrumentalist and songwriting partner-in-crime Nigel Hall, among many others. \u201cThere\u2019s such a great pool of talent in New Orleans,\u201d Cleary comments. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a real pleasure to work with such a wide variety of the local characters. I\u2019ve been so lucky to have played with so many great New Orleans rhythm sections over the years. And I love recording with Nigel; he\u2019s an inspiring creative accomplice.\u201d\nDyna-Mite flows seamlessly, from straight-up New Orleans grooves \u00e0 la Professor Longhair \u2013 such as the raucous, streetwise title track \u2013 to shades of classic \u201970s soul reminiscent of Bobby Womack, as heard on the lush, plaintive \u201c21st Century Gypsy Singing Lover Man,\u201d which Cleary co-wrote with Taj Mahal. \u201cThat song is about a musician\u2019s life on the road \u2013 we wandering minstrels represent the world\u2019s second-oldest profession,\u201d Clearly wryly notes. \u201cSkin In The Game\u201d explores a similarly reflective mode, utilizing a deep-pocket 1-6-2-5 chord progression. \u201cHit, Git, Quit, Split,\u201d by contrast, is a joyous interlude of classic New Orleans wordplay and double-talk, as exemplified by such gems of skewed Crescent City logic as \u201cTake your time, we ain\u2019t got all night!\u201d (\u201cWe were having so much fun with that song in the studio,\u201d Cleary recalls, \u201cthat it went on for about 20 minutes, so we had to trim it a bit to fit here on the finished album.\u201d) \u201cBig Greasy\u201d incorporates a New Orleans sensibility with the related Afro-Caribbean sounds of Jamaica \u2013 \u201ca hybrid,\u201d Cleary explains, \u201cof putting Crescent City funk and reggae through a blender.\u201d Cleary originally wrote \u201cFrenchmen Street Blues\u201d to be played at a friend\u2019s funeral, and it was recorded again for use in the popular HBO television drama Treme. In reprising it here on Dyna-Mite, Cleary utilized an approach to songwriting in which compositions may be worked and reworked for years. \u201cI have bits and pieces of songs on cassettes, hard drives, and scraps of paper. I love to keep tinkering with them, sometimes for years, until eventually I feel that they are finished and ready to record.\u201d Dyna-Mite closes out, appropriately, with \u201cAll Good Things.\u201d\nWebsite\n\nFAQs\nPLEASE CLICK HERE FOR A DETAILED FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

He reached out to friends in Los Angeles, in London, but nothing seemed right.\nMeantime, Eric Burton had recently made his way to Texas. Born in the San Fernando Valley, he grew up in church and then got heavily involved in musical theater. He started busking at the Santa Monica pier, where he brought in a few hundred dollars a day and developed his performance skills. Burton traveled through the Western states before deciding to settle down in Austin -- setting up his busking spot on a downtown street corner, at 6th Street and Congress, for maximum exposure.\nA mutual friend mentioned Burton to Quesada, saying that he was the best singer he had ever heard. The two musicians connected, but Burton took a while to respond (\u201cMy friends were like \u2018Dude, you\u2019re a mad man, you need to hit that guy back!\u2019\u201c) Finally, he called Quesada, and started singing to one of the tracks over the phone. \u201cI loved his energy, his vibe, and I knew it would be incredible on record,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom the moment I heard him on the phone, I was all about it.\u201dThe results of that inauspicious beginning can now be heard on the self-titled debut album from Black Pumas, the group that Quesada and Burton assembled, which has become one of the year\u2019s most anticipated projects. Described as \u201cWu-Tang Clan meets James Brown\u201d by KCRW, Black Pumas were the winner of Best New Band at the 2019 Austin Music Awards.\nQuesada has a storied reputation from playing in bands like Grupo Fantasma and Brownout, accompanying artists from Prince to Daniel Johnston, and producing such acclaimed projects as 2018\u2019s Look at My Soul: The Latin Shade Of Texas Soul. For the tracks that kicked off this project, though, he had a different direction in mind. \u201cI was looking for somebody with their own identity,\u201d says Quesada, \u201cwho liked Neil Young as much as Sam Cooke.\u201d\nBurton\u2019s taste, range, and experience proved to be exactly what Quesada was seeking. \u201cWe just take to the same kind of music,\u201d he says. \u201cI listen to East Coast hip-hop, old soul music, folk music. When Adrian sent me the songs, it was like I had already heard them before. We were on the same wavelength from the get-go.\u201d\nThe first day they got together in the studio, they recorded the dusty funk that would become the Black Pumas\u2019 first two singles, \u201cBlack Moon Rising\u201d and \u201cFire.\u201d Quesada had written the music for \u201cBlack Moon Rising\u201d on the day of the 2017 solar eclipse, and Burton took that concept and ran with it. \u201cRight away, the hair stood up on the back of my neck,\u201d says Quesada. \u201cI knew, \u2018This is it -- this is the guy.\u2019\u201d\nBurton sensed the potential, as well. \u201cWhen I saw that Adrian played with Prince and had a Grammy,\u201d he says, \u201cthat he was a serious, respected artist, I knew that I would do my best not to squander that. If you can do it on the street, for a long time, without making yourself crazy, you can do it with a guy who\u2019s won a Grammy.\u201d\nThe duo also knew that they didn\u2019t want their sound to be too retro or imitative. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to just do throwback soul and pretend that hip-hop never happened,\u201d says Quesada, noting that it was listening to Ghostface Killah that initially triggered him to start writing this material. \u201cIt had to feel sincere coming from us. I have a certain aesthetic in the studio, Eric has a voice that evokes a certain era, but I don\u2019t think we reference that too directly.\u201d\n\u201cAdrian has had the time and the interest to really dive into a specific sound, to recreate something he heard on a Motown record,\u201d adds Burton. \u201cAnd because of that specific knowledge, he provides an interesting sandbox for me, whose background is in theater, to do something super-unorthodox -- to be an art student and play with all the colors I have, but to put it on something that\u2019s more familiar to listeners\u2019 ears.\u201d\nWith Black Pumas having evolved from an idea to a session to an album, they decided to put a band together and see how this music sounded live. They booked a residency at C Boys (a sister venue to Austin\u2019s famed Continental Club), initially playing every Thursday for a month. \u201cWe only rehearsed twice, we had no idea what we were getting ourselves into,\u201d says Quesada. \u201cBut with the first show, we knew it was unique, special -- the chemistry and fire were there immediately. And what Eric could do as a frontman was like nothing I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d\nAs word got out, the C Boys shows turned into a local phenomenon (\u201cthe hottest party in town,\u201d according to the Austin American-Statesman), with lines around the block despite the fact that the band had only released one song.

He reached out to friends in Los Angeles, in London, but nothing seemed right.</P>\n<P>Meantime, Eric Burton had recently made his way to Texas. Born in the San Fernando Valley, he grew up in church and then got heavily involved in musical theater. He started busking at the Santa Monica pier, where he brought in a few hundred dollars a day and developed his performance skills. Burton traveled through the Western states before deciding to settle down in Austin -- setting up his busking spot on a downtown street corner, at 6th Street and Congress, for maximum exposure.</P>\n<P>A mutual friend mentioned Burton to Quesada, saying that he was the best singer he had ever heard. The two musicians connected, but Burton took a while to respond (\u201cMy friends were like \u2018Dude, you\u2019re a mad man, you need to hit that guy back!\u2019\u201c) Finally, he called Quesada, and started singing to one of the tracks over the phone. \u201cI loved his energy, his vibe, and I knew it would be incredible on record,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom the moment I heard him on the phone, I was all about it.\u201d<BR>The results of that inauspicious beginning can now be heard on the self-titled debut album from Black Pumas, the group that Quesada and Burton assembled, which has become one of the year\u2019s most anticipated projects. Described as \u201cWu-Tang Clan meets James Brown\u201d by KCRW, Black Pumas were the winner of Best New Band at the 2019 Austin Music Awards.</P>\n<P>Quesada has a storied reputation from playing in bands like Grupo Fantasma and Brownout, accompanying artists from Prince to Daniel Johnston, and producing such acclaimed projects as 2018\u2019s Look at My Soul: The Latin Shade Of Texas Soul. For the tracks that kicked off this project, though, he had a different direction in mind. \u201cI was looking for somebody with their own identity,\u201d says Quesada, \u201cwho liked Neil Young as much as Sam Cooke.\u201d</P>\n<P>Burton\u2019s taste, range, and experience proved to be exactly what Quesada was seeking. \u201cWe just take to the same kind of music,\u201d he says. \u201cI listen to East Coast hip-hop, old soul music, folk music. When Adrian sent me the songs, it was like I had already heard them before. We were on the same wavelength from the get-go.\u201d</P>\n<P>The first day they got together in the studio, they recorded the dusty funk that would become the Black Pumas\u2019 first two singles, \u201cBlack Moon Rising\u201d and \u201cFire.\u201d Quesada had written the music for \u201cBlack Moon Rising\u201d on the day of the 2017 solar eclipse, and Burton took that concept and ran with it. \u201cRight away, the hair stood up on the back of my neck,\u201d says Quesada. \u201cI knew, \u2018This is it -- this is the guy.\u2019\u201d</P>\n<P>Burton sensed the potential, as well. \u201cWhen I saw that Adrian played with Prince and had a Grammy,\u201d he says, \u201cthat he was a serious, respected artist, I knew that I would do my best not to squander that. If you can do it on the street, for a long time, without making yourself crazy, you can do it with a guy who\u2019s won a Grammy.\u201d</P>\n<P>The duo also knew that they didn\u2019t want their sound to be too retro or imitative. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to just do throwback soul and pretend that hip-hop never happened,\u201d says Quesada, noting that it was listening to Ghostface Killah that initially triggered him to start writing this material. \u201cIt had to feel sincere coming from us. I have a certain aesthetic in the studio, Eric has a voice that evokes a certain era, but I don\u2019t think we reference that too directly.\u201d</P>\n<P>\u201cAdrian has had the time and the interest to really dive into a specific sound, to recreate something he heard on a Motown record,\u201d adds Burton. \u201cAnd because of that specific knowledge, he provides an interesting sandbox for me, whose background is in theater, to do something super-unorthodox -- to be an art student and play with all the colors I have, but to put it on something that\u2019s more familiar to listeners\u2019 ears.\u201d</P>\n<P>With Black Pumas having evolved from an idea to a session to an album, they decided to put a band together and see how this music sounded live. They booked a residency at C Boys (a sister venue to Austin\u2019s famed Continental Club), initially playing every Thursday for a month. \u201cWe only rehearsed twice, we had no idea what we were getting ourselves into,\u201d says Quesada. \u201cBut with the first show, we knew it was unique, special -- the chemistry and fire were there immediately. And what Eric could do as a frontman was like nothing I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d</P>\n<P>As word got out, the C Boys shows turned into a local phenomenon (\u201cthe hottest party in town,\u201d according to the Austin American-Statesman), with lines around the block despite the fact that the band had only released one song. The reaction to the group\u2019s recent South by Southwest appearance helps explain the mania -- the Chicago Tribune called Burton\u2019s performance \u201ca whirlwind of movement and gesture,\u201d while Rolling Stone, in naming Black Pumas \u201cOne Of The 30 Best Bands We Saw In Austin,\u201d wrote that \u201cthe hometown six-piece\u2019s grooves were funky in a thick, viscous way, oozing out in ambitious jams that wandered into heady territory without meandering\u201d and praising Burton\u2019s \u201ctireless, charismatic energy.\u201d</P>\n<P>The other, unexpected result of the C Boys residency was that Burton presented more of his own songs to help fill out the set, which led Black Pumas into new territory. \u201cEric had all these other songs based on other styles, going back into what he was doing when he was busking,\u201d says Quesada. \u201cIt was a real spark that we could huddle around him and his songs, too, and get a real sense of what our sound was.\u201d</P>\n<P>In fact, the final song recorded for Black Pumas was \u201cOctober 33,\u201d a tense, pleading ballad by Burton. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like we had the right last song,\u201d says Quesada, \u201cwe needed something with more of Eric on guitar.

Artist\nGenre:\u00a0\u00a0Singer/Songwriter\nIndie icon Ben Kweller returns with some of the strongest music of his career. He didn't go away just because -- he was fifteen minutes away from death. \"We almost died,\" Kweller says. \"Me, Lizzy, our two boys... dead. We wouldn't be here if Liz hadn't woken up that night.\"\nKweller is referring to an ill-fated trip to the mountains of New Mexico, back in 2013. The family went on what was meant to be a winter wonderland vacation and instead suffered acute carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\"We were in this sweet little cabin and in the middle of the night, Lizzy woke up and said, 'Ben, get up! Something's wrong -- I feel horrible,'\" Kweller says. \"I immediately jumped out of bed and collapsed to the ground. We instinctively crawled to the front door and opened it. Fresh air rushed in the cabin. I called 911. We grabbed the boys out of bed, trying to shake them awake, and managed to get everyone outside in the snow. The boys were crying and falling in and out of consciousness -- it was like something out of a horror film,\" Kweller says. \"When the ambulances arrived, they tested our blood and said our CO levels were so high, we were 15 minutes away from not waking up. Fifteen minutes! We spent the next day in the hospital on pure oxygen and days after that feeling lethargic and mush-brained. When we got back home, I was an incapacitated zombie. I told my team to cancel everything. I was done.\"\nAs the months rolled on, Kweller began to battle depression as a result of the poisoning. There was a period where the \"Sundress\" singer didn't think he'd ever see the stage again. \"I just didn't care -- I didn't want to play music anymore,\" Kweller says. \"I didn't want to leave my family's side, and for the first time in my life I was scared. When you almost die, everything changes, and all the unimportant sh*t disappears. Luckily, I kept writing songs and they got me through some really dark places. Eventually I had 50 ready to go but I was still reluctant to start the machine back up again. A close friend of mine called me up and said, 'Just come over and let's record something together. Even if it's just a demo, maybe it'll make you feel better.'\"\nThat close friend was producer and songwriter, Dwight A. Baker (Misseo, Brandi Carlile). One thing led to another and the two ended up co-producing an entire album. The album is called, Circuit Boredom, and lucky for us, it will be released! The first single, \"Heart Attack Kid,\" was released in early '19 with a music video co-directed by Superorganism's Robert Strange. The BK touring machine is also gearing back up with shows in North America, Europe, Japan, and Australia.\nWith a regretful sigh, Kweller shares \"There were so many times over the past five years that a fan would come up to me and say, 'Dude, where have you been?' \"rather than going into detail, I'd shrug it off and say, 'man, I needed a break, but I'll come back one day.' Inside, I wasn't sure, though.\"\nA major turning point that convinced Kweller to put music back into the world, was the loss of his friend Anton Yelchin. The two had a close bond and even shared the silver screen in Rudderless, a music-based drama directed by William H. Macy. \"I'm still in awe of Anton's creative output and all that he achieved in such a short period of time,\" Kweller says. \"One of my best friends, gone in the blink of an eye -- it absolutely woke me up. I knew I had to overcome my own trauma and do what I was born to do. Plus, Anton would've thought it rude if I didn't share these songs.\"\nAll of this comes as a relief to BK fans, whom, for over 15 years, have sung along to his anthems and cried to his ballads. They know his gift for jumping through genres while remaining heartfelt and authentic. They also know that nostalgia and optimism were his trademarks long before his run-in with mortality. Now, with the forthcoming release of Circuit Boredom, we are reminded that a light really is at the end of the tunnel, we just have to listen for it. We're glad BK's back.\nWebsite\n\nFAQs\nPLEASE CLICK\u00a0HERE\u00a0FOR A MORE DETAILED FAQ.\u00a0\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

He sang in the church choir until age 16 when his family moved to Panama City Florida, where he found himself surrounded by like-minded blues lovers. Wearing a fake mustache, young James slipped into a still segregated black nightclub to see Little Junior Parker\u2019s show. He was totally overtaken by the blues and soon became a regular, known as \u201cThat boy who sings like a man\u201d by patrons.\nWhile still in his teens, he started playing juke joints and dance clubs throughout the South. His performances became legendary-he was \u201ctapped\u201d by talent scouts, signed and taken to Atlanta, Georgia in 1964 to begin his recording career at age 18. He had a series of nine singles (45 RPM records) released during the mid to late 60's on obscure southern labels. He tried several restarts in new home bases including Chicago in \u201965, New York in \u201966, Miami in \u201968 and New Orleans in \u201869.\nDuring his stay in Miami Harman was befriended by fellow record collectors Henry Vestine, Alan Wilson and Bob Hite of Canned Heat, who persuaded him to move to California, promising to help him get re-started. Harman made his move to SoCal in 1970, and true to their word, Canned Heat insisted on Harman\u2019s Icehouse Blues Band as their opening act on many big shows. Icehouse Blues Band became established at venues such as The Golden Bear, The Ash Grove, The Troubadour and The Lighthouse, which all booked real blues artists.\nJames Harman was soon in demand for his own shows, as well as backing every living blues artist who was touring without a band. He also opened literally hundreds of shows for artist who did have their own band. Icehouse Blues Band was a real working blues band. In 1978 James tired of using band names and started billing his act as James Harman Band.\nSome alumni include Phil Alvin, Bill Bateman, Gene Taylor, David \u201cKid\u201d Ramos, Michael \u201cHollywood Fats\u201d Mann, Stephen Taylor Hodges and Jeff \u201cBig Dad\u201d Turmes. All of these players did long stints in the Harman Band. James is often cited as a bandleader who gave many now famous bluesmen their start. Harman stopped ground touring in 2000 and now only takes blues festival dates around the world. Nathan James has been James Harman\u2019s regular band guitar player since 1997 when he was 19 years old... he turned 37 in 2015 and he's still Harman's favorite! Nathan is also James\u2019 recording engineer and co-producer on his own projects, as well as projects they produce for other artists.\nJames Harman\u2019s side project: Bamboo Porch Revue features guitarist Nathan James playing rollicking, low-down, juke-joint blues over James Michael Tempo\u2019s Afro-Cuban percussion, Troy Sandow\u2019s sparse, pulsating acoustic bass and Marty Dodson's masterful drumming. Through his long career starting in the early 60\u2019s James Harman has built up an enormous song catalog and had 20 of his original songs used in movies and television. He has been nominated for 20 pestiferous W. C. Handy (Blues Foundation) awards. He was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame, and he is the harmonica player of choice on many ZZ Top releases, as well as live with them on many international TV shows. James Harman has had 33 releases, on many different labels; he currently tours every spring, summer, and fall, working in as many as 29 countries. Harman was nominated for a Grammy Award, and won two Blues Music Awards for his contribution to the Blind Pig release, \"Remembering Little Walter\" in 2014. He is a one of a kind songwriter, producer, musician, showman, vocalist, and internationally known bluesman.\nin 2015 Electro-Fi release \"BONETIME\" was nominated for an unprecedented five BMA awards: SONG OF THE YEAR, ALBUM OF THE YEAR, TRADITIONAL ALBUM OF THE YEAR, HARMONICA PLAYER and TRADITIONAL BLUES MALE ARTIST OF THE YEAR.\nDon't miss him when you see him advertised in your area as he is currently ON TOUR!\n\n\nPRESENTED BY\u00a0MAGELLAN\u00a0CORPORATION\n\nFAQs\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

His performances became legendary-he was \u201ctapped\u201d by talent scouts, signed and taken to Atlanta, Georgia in 1964 to begin his recording career at age 18. He had a series of nine singles (45 RPM records) released during the mid to late 60's on obscure southern labels. He tried several restarts in new home bases including Chicago in \u201965, New York in \u201966, Miami in \u201968 and New Orleans in \u201869.</P>\n<P>During his stay in Miami Harman was befriended by fellow record collectors Henry Vestine, Alan Wilson and Bob Hite of Canned Heat, who persuaded him to move to California, promising to help him get re-started. Harman made his move to SoCal in 1970, and true to their word, Canned Heat insisted on Harman\u2019s Icehouse Blues Band as their opening act on many big shows. Icehouse Blues Band became established at venues such as The Golden Bear, The Ash Grove, The Troubadour and The Lighthouse, which all booked real blues artists.</P>\n<P>James Harman was soon in demand for his own shows, as well as backing every living blues artist who was touring without a band. He also opened literally hundreds of shows for artist who did have their own band. Icehouse Blues Band was a real working blues band. In 1978 James tired of using band names and started billing his act as James Harman Band.</P>\n<P>Some alumni include Phil Alvin, Bill Bateman, Gene Taylor, David \u201cKid\u201d Ramos, Michael \u201cHollywood Fats\u201d Mann, Stephen Taylor Hodges and Jeff \u201cBig Dad\u201d Turmes. All of these players did long stints in the Harman Band. James is often cited as a bandleader who gave many now famous bluesmen their start. Harman stopped ground touring in 2000 and now only takes blues festival dates around the world. Nathan James has been James Harman\u2019s regular band guitar player since 1997 when he was 19 years old... he turned 37 in 2015 and he's still Harman's favorite! Nathan is also James\u2019 recording engineer and co-producer on his own projects, as well as projects they produce for other artists.</P>\n<P>James Harman\u2019s side project: Bamboo Porch Revue features guitarist Nathan James playing rollicking, low-down, juke-joint blues over James Michael Tempo\u2019s Afro-Cuban percussion, Troy Sandow\u2019s sparse, pulsating acoustic bass and Marty Dodson's masterful drumming. Through his long career starting in the early 60\u2019s James Harman has built up an enormous song catalog and had 20 of his original songs used in movies and television. He has been nominated for 20 pestiferous W. C. Handy (Blues Foundation) awards. He was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame, and he is the harmonica player of choice on many ZZ Top releases, as well as live with them on many international TV shows. James Harman has had 33 releases, on many different labels; he currently tours every spring, summer, and fall, working in as many as 29 countries. Harman was nominated for a Grammy Award, and won two Blues Music Awards for his contribution to the Blind Pig release, \"Remembering Little Walter\" in 2014. He is a one of a kind songwriter, producer, musician, showman, vocalist, and internationally known bluesman.</P>\n<P>in 2015 Electro-Fi release \"BONETIME\" was nominated for an unprecedented five BMA awards: SONG OF THE YEAR, ALBUM OF THE YEAR, TRADITIONAL ALBUM OF THE YEAR, HARMONICA PLAYER and TRADITIONAL BLUES MALE ARTIST OF THE YEAR.</P>\n<P>Don't miss him when you see him advertised in your area as he is currently ON TOUR!<BR></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P><STRONG><EM>PRESENTED BY\u00a0<A HREF=\"https://www.e-magellan.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">MAGELLAN\u00a0CORPORATION</A></EM></STRONG></P>\n<P CLASS=\"m_-3648010561683675205gmail-font_7\"><IMG SRC=\"https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/223805690/magellanlogo.jpg\"></P>\n<H2><STRONG>FAQs</STRONG></H2>\n<P><STRONG>Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0</STRONG>Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.
