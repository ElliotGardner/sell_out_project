Featuring the classic line up of Sid Griffin, Stephen McCarthy, Tom Stevens and Greg Sowders, it makes the day after Valentine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day a musical romantic celebration. The stunning new album follows hot on the heels of the November 30 deluxe reissue treatment given to two classic Long Ryders long players, State Of Our Union and Two Fisted Tales.\nThe story behind the making of Psychedelic Country Soul is arguably thirty years overdue, as Sid Griffin explains: \"For years, for decades, the band's dear friend Larry Chatman said he would never forget Sid & Co for hiring him for tour after tour in the 1980s. 'I'll pay you guys back one day' was Larry's mantra. Fast forward to 2016 and I got a call from Larry, who is now Dr. Dre's personal assistant. Larry made the Long Ryders an offer they could not refuse; a week in Dr. Dre's state of the art studio in Los Angeles.\nGriffin leapt at the generous offer and rounded up the Long Ryders for yet another cavalry charge. They secured the services of their last producer, Ed Stasium (The Ramones, The Smithereens, Belinda Carlisle, Jeff Healey Band, etc.), traded demos, agreed on the material, learned the songs at home, rehearsed together in Los Angeles, recorded the album at Dre's in eight days, mixed the tracks at Ed's home studio, and BANG! A key link in the Americana chain was back in the saddle and back on top.\nThe recording sessions went smoothly, as old friends The Bangles dropped by to add harmonies, legendary rock photographer Henry Diltz took some photos while the guys worked, and the outcome was another storming album of alternative Americana.\nFeaturing eleven new Long Ryders compositions and a tribute cover of the late great Tom Petty's song Walls, this is a Long Ryders for the 21st century; kicking off with the anthemic Greenville, a track which proves the band haven't lost any of that magic guitar interplay. Molly Somebody is an eclectic pop tune that doesn't neglect any of their country and rock sensibilities, while the likes of What The Eagle Sees reflects the energy of early punk and power pop that so informed them in the early days. You can still hear their personal connection with the music of the 1960s, but as ever The Long Ryders aren't a band who live in the past. Album closer Psychedelic Country Soul is the greatest testament to that, performed like the previous 11 songs, with precision and fire; the guitars weave and harmonicas build and ebb, the song spreading like wildfire. The Long Ryders have always been celebrated for what they have to say as much as the music they make. With Psychedelic Country Soul their message delivered with 12 strings and never ending harmonies has never been clearer.\nThis is a Long Ryders album which stands up with their classic albums like Native Sons and their unforgettable single Looking For Lewis And Clark. Psychedelic Country Soul will certainly sit on many Best Of lists at the end of the year. But you can note its worthiness when you hear it February 15, 2019.

But with his new album,\u00a0Dragons, his subject material finds the singer using a finer brush and mixing more of the joys, struggles, and specific moments of his own life than ever before to help him paint his masterpieces and connect with fans on a universal level. With its modern production, careful sense of craft and collaboration, and rafter-reaching anthems carrying profound, intentional lyrics, the album represents Drew Holcomb and The Neighbors\u2019s biggest moment yet, a powerful portrait stretched across a wide sonic canvas.The story of\u00a0Dragons\u00a0is the culmination of myriad events, connections, challenges, and years of hard, determined work for Holcomb, both as a bandleader and a family man. For the last decade, the Tennessee-based musician has established himself as one of Americana and Southern roots music\u2019s freshest upstarts, building his following and critical appeal with every release, show, and venture. From his position as curator and entrepreneur with various undertakings\u2014from co-creator of the successful, diverse Moon River Music Festival that makes its sold-out home in Chattanooga this Fall, to the Magnolia Record Club vinyl subscription program that he founded and curates on a monthly basis\u2014to his role of husband for the last 14 years and father to three children, Holcomb cites the nature of his life of late as equal parts \u201ccollaborative\u201d and \u201cchaotic.\u201d Having released a full-length Neighbors album,\u00a0Souvenir, in 2017 to much acclaim, a co-released EP with Johnnyswim,\u00a0Goodbye Road, in 2018, enjoyed the stripped-down and mostly sold-out \u201cYou & Me\u201d tour with his wife, singer Ellie Holcomb, in 2018 and early 2019, and opened larger shows for Willie Nelson and the Zac Brown Band with The Neighbors, Holcomb\u2019s legend and reach continues to grow. So when it came time to begin work on a new album, he forced himself to try something different and to mine untapped territory\u2014and in a manner he had never before attempted.As Holcomb embarked on the tour for\u00a0Souvenir\u00a0in 2017, he disciplined himself to write new songs in a more consistent manner than his past efforts. Where his previous work was written more in lump sum moments during specific blocks of time set aside for creative outburst, he found that spending two to three days each week with his guitar in hand and working on new material yielded better results in both quantity and diversity. Inspired to \u201cthrow off some self-imposed shackles\u201d in terms of subject matter and style, the new material was shaping up to point him in an altogether new and exciting direction\u2014and perhaps because he had opened himself up to writing while his \u201cnormal\u201d life was rolling along, the songs began to take on a more intimate point of view.To assist him with the scope of the challenge, Holcomb turned to his friends and peers for collaboration\u2014in fact, six of\u00a0Dragons\u2019s ten songs are co-writes. Even though he was writing about his own unique experiences, Holcomb discovered that the support of other trusted ears and hearts proved valuable beyond his estimation. From working with the legendary Lori McKenna on several songs and country songwriting star Natalie Hemby on another, to previous tourmate Sean McConnell as well as Zach Williams of The Lone Bellow, Holcomb learned how to reap the benefits of sharing without being territorial while ultimately serving his own vision for the pieces at large. He also co-wrote the song \u201cBittersweet\u201d with producer and songwriter Cason Cooley (Ingrid Michaelson, American Authors), loving the process and result so much that he invited Cooley to produce the entire album.Cooley took Holcomb and the Neighbors to the esteemed Echo Mountain studio in Asheville, North Carolina, to record in January of 2019. They shared a vision for the finished album that would give it a more modern sound than Holcomb\u2019s previous recordings, with his songs balancing the line of large, layered anthems with nuanced singer-songwriter moments\u2014or, as he says, \u201cexpanding the emotional architecture of the songs so that the bigger themes and emotions would have space to hit harder.\u201d Having always allowed his band\u2014including Rich Brinsfield on bass, Nathan Dugger on guitar, and session drummer Will Sayles\u2014to play by its own rules, Holcomb and company again embraced that ethos and remained open-minded for the inclusion of any instrument, tweak, technique, or style as long as it served the human element and earnest feeling of each song. Several were tracked live with minimal studio tweaking occurring afterwards, and others were built over time with a more fastidious approach. The result is Holcomb\u2019s brightest and most complex album yet, a focused and cohesive affair that challenges the sonic notions of where his music can travel while still connecting directly to his listeners\u2019 hearts.Dragons\u00a0begins with\u00a0\u201cFamily,\u201d\u00a0an infectious, upbeat stomper about the universal yet unique nostalgia of growing up, as told through the reflective lens of fatherhood. \u201cMy family gave me wings to be a songwriter,\u201d Holcomb says. \u201cFamily can drive you crazy but it can also be the tie that binds.\u201d\u00a0A staple in the band\u2019s live set for the past year, it originally had more of a front porch feel but evolved into its worldly, amped-up Paul Simon-esque version during the recording process. Next, \u201cEnd of the World\u201d\u00a0is an electrified clarion call for unity, community, and revelry in the upside-down world of today\u2014Holcomb\u2019s take on\u00a0eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow you die. \u201cSometimes throwing a party is the only way to fight off the darkness, and I wanted it to be an epic, boisterous, raise-your-glass-and-yell-with-me anthem,\u201d he says.

Inspired by Holcomb\u2019s grandfather, a larger-than-life personality who embodied the spirit of living to his peak until his final days, the song imagines his ghost-like return to visit Holcomb in a dream.

But with his new album,\u00a0Dragons, his subject material finds the singer using a finer brush and mixing more of the joys, struggles, and specific moments of his own life than ever before to help him paint his masterpieces and connect with fans on a universal level. With its modern production, careful sense of craft and collaboration, and rafter-reaching anthems carrying profound, intentional lyrics, the album represents Drew Holcomb and The Neighbors\u2019s biggest moment yet, a powerful portrait stretched across a wide sonic canvas.</P><P>The story of\u00a0Dragons\u00a0is the culmination of myriad events, connections, challenges, and years of hard, determined work for Holcomb, both as a bandleader and a family man. For the last decade, the Tennessee-based musician has established himself as one of Americana and Southern roots music\u2019s freshest upstarts, building his following and critical appeal with every release, show, and venture. From his position as curator and entrepreneur with various undertakings\u2014from co-creator of the successful, diverse Moon River Music Festival that makes its sold-out home in Chattanooga this Fall, to the Magnolia Record Club vinyl subscription program that he founded and curates on a monthly basis\u2014to his role of husband for the last 14 years and father to three children, Holcomb cites the nature of his life of late as equal parts \u201ccollaborative\u201d and \u201cchaotic.\u201d Having released a full-length Neighbors album,\u00a0Souvenir, in 2017 to much acclaim, a co-released EP with Johnnyswim,\u00a0Goodbye Road, in 2018, enjoyed the stripped-down and mostly sold-out \u201cYou &amp; Me\u201d tour with his wife, singer Ellie Holcomb, in 2018 and early 2019, and opened larger shows for Willie Nelson and the Zac Brown Band with The Neighbors, Holcomb\u2019s legend and reach continues to grow. So when it came time to begin work on a new album, he forced himself to try something different and to mine untapped territory\u2014and in a manner he had never before attempted.</P><P>As Holcomb embarked on the tour for\u00a0Souvenir\u00a0in 2017, he disciplined himself to write new songs in a more consistent manner than his past efforts. Where his previous work was written more in lump sum moments during specific blocks of time set aside for creative outburst, he found that spending two to three days each week with his guitar in hand and working on new material yielded better results in both quantity and diversity. Inspired to \u201cthrow off some self-imposed shackles\u201d in terms of subject matter and style, the new material was shaping up to point him in an altogether new and exciting direction\u2014and perhaps because he had opened himself up to writing while his \u201cnormal\u201d life was rolling along, the songs began to take on a more intimate point of view.</P><P>To assist him with the scope of the challenge, Holcomb turned to his friends and peers for collaboration\u2014in fact, six of\u00a0Dragons\u2019s ten songs are co-writes. Even though he was writing about his own unique experiences, Holcomb discovered that the support of other trusted ears and hearts proved valuable beyond his estimation. From working with the legendary Lori McKenna on several songs and country songwriting star Natalie Hemby on another, to previous tourmate Sean McConnell as well as Zach Williams of The Lone Bellow, Holcomb learned how to reap the benefits of sharing without being territorial while ultimately serving his own vision for the pieces at large. He also co-wrote the song \u201cBittersweet\u201d with producer and songwriter Cason Cooley (Ingrid Michaelson, American Authors), loving the process and result so much that he invited Cooley to produce the entire album.</P><P>Cooley took Holcomb and the Neighbors to the esteemed Echo Mountain studio in Asheville, North Carolina, to record in January of 2019. They shared a vision for the finished album that would give it a more modern sound than Holcomb\u2019s previous recordings, with his songs balancing the line of large, layered anthems with nuanced singer-songwriter moments\u2014or, as he says, \u201cexpanding the emotional architecture of the songs so that the bigger themes and emotions would have space to hit harder.\u201d Having always allowed his band\u2014including Rich Brinsfield on bass, Nathan Dugger on guitar, and session drummer Will Sayles\u2014to play by its own rules, Holcomb and company again embraced that ethos and remained open-minded for the inclusion of any instrument, tweak, technique, or style as long as it served the human element and earnest feeling of each song. Several were tracked live with minimal studio tweaking occurring afterwards, and others were built over time with a more fastidious approach. The result is Holcomb\u2019s brightest and most complex album yet, a focused and cohesive affair that challenges the sonic notions of where his music can travel while still connecting directly to his listeners\u2019 hearts.</P><P>Dragons\u00a0begins with\u00a0\u201cFamily,\u201d\u00a0an infectious, upbeat stomper about the universal yet unique nostalgia of growing up, as told through the reflective lens of fatherhood. \u201cMy family gave me wings to be a songwriter,\u201d Holcomb says. \u201cFamily can drive you crazy but it can also be the tie that binds.\u201d\u00a0A staple in the band\u2019s live set for the past year, it originally had more of a front porch feel but evolved into its worldly, amped-up Paul Simon-esque version during the recording process. Next, \u201cEnd of the World\u201d\u00a0is an electrified clarion call for unity, community, and revelry in the upside-down world of today\u2014Holcomb\u2019s take on\u00a0eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow you die. \u201cSometimes throwing a party is the only way to fight off the darkness, and I wanted it to be an epic, boisterous, raise-your-glass-and-yell-with-me anthem,\u201d he says. The song forced him out of his comfort zone and stretches him to new vocal and melodic heights, resulting in one of the most rewarding moments of his career to date.</P><P>A similar triumph from a different corner of his soul is \u201cYou Never Leave My Heart,\u201d\u00a0a touching and tender daydream filled with sadness that Holcomb wrote right after the New Year about the death of his brother nearly 20 years ago.

Mixing rock and country with jazz and blues, he's found what connects them: improvisation and a sense of play. Unlike other pastichists, who tend to duck passion, Mr. Frisell plays up the pleasure in the music and also takes on another often-avoided subject, tenderness.\" -- The New York Times\n\"Frisell is a revered figure among musicians -- like Miles Davis and few others, his signature is built from pure sound and inflection; an anti-technique that is instantly identifiable.\" -- The Philadelphia Inquirer\nDescribed as being at the very epicenter of modern American Music\" (BBC), Bill Frisell's career as a guitarist and composer has spanned more than 35 years and 250 recordings, including 40 of his own. Frisell's recording catalog has been cited by Downbeat as \"the best recorded output of the decade,\" including his recent albums for Savoy -- Sign of Life with the 858 Quartet, Beautiful Dreamers with his trio, and All We Are Saying, a new collection of John Lennon interpretations.\u00a0\nFrisell's recording, Big Sur, was his debut for Okeh/Sony Masterworks and features music commissioned by the Monterey Jazz Festival and was composed at the Glen Deven Ranch in Big Sur. The album's unusual instrumentation of strings and drums comes alive in a newly assembled quintet comprised of long-time associates from his groups, the 858 Quartet and Beautiful Dreamers.\nFrisell's Nonesuch output spans a wide range of musical expression, from original Buster Keaton film scores, to arrangements for extended ensembles with horns and strings (Blues Dream, Grammy-nominated History, Mystery and Grammy winner, Unspeakable), to collaborations with bassist Viktor Krauss and drummer Jim Keltner (Gone, Just Like a Train). Other releases include an album with Nashville musicians (Nashville), a solo album (Ghost Town), a collection of traditional American folk songs and originals inspired by them (The Willies), and two trio albums -- one with jazz legends Dave Holland and Elvin Jones, the other with Ron Carter and Paul Motian. The GRAMMY- nominated The Intercontinentals combines Frisell's brand of American roots music with Brazilian, Greek, and Malian influences. Disfarmer was inspired by the work of the mid-century rural Arkansas photographer Mike Disfarmer. Floratone is Frisell's cooperative group of drummer Matt Chamberlain, long-time producer Lee Townsend and Tucker Martine, with whom he has recorded two albums. Silent Comedy (Tzadik) is a solo project filled with complex harmonies, delicate phrasing, and wild noises, produced by long-time musical colleague John Zorn.\u00a0\nRecognized as one of America's 21 most vital and productive performing artists, Frisell was named an inaugural Doris Duke Artist in April 2012. He is also a recipient of grants from United States Artists, Meet the Composer, and National Performance Network. Currently Frisell is the Guest Curator for the Roots of Americana series at Jazz at Lincoln Center and Resident Artistic Director at San Francisco Jazz.\nAlways on the lookout for opportunities to \"dig around for where I'm coming from,\" Frisell's next project will be an homage to the instrumental popular music made \"right at the birth of the Fender Telecaster guitar\" that, he recalls, \"got me super fired up\" about his instrument of choice. Frisell will joined by fellow guitar master Greg Leisz on electric and pedal steel guitars, and his trio partners Tony Scherr on bass and Kenny Wollesen on drums. Together they will be exploring music of the Guitar in the Space Age -- Speedy West and Jimmy Bryant, Charlie Christian, B.B. King, Merle Travis, Jimi Hendrix, Link Wray, Duane Eddy, Chet Atkins, Chuck Berry, Dick Dale, The Ventures, The Astronauts,The Wrecking Crew, and more. As on all Frisell projects, the proceedings will be, he understates, \"rich with possibility.\"\nWebsite\n\nFAQs\nPLEASE CLICK HERE FOR A DETAILED FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

Carnivorous begins with a fanfare of synths, which lead into a pounding, throbbing dancefloor bassline, an Arabesque lead guitar figure, and electronic percussion patterns \u2013 yet underneath it all there\u2019s still a blisteringly powerful rock\u2019n\u2019roll band. \u201cCarnivorous opened the window for the thought: What can we do now? What are we capable of?\u201d says bassist and singer Emma Richardson. \u201cIt was the first step towards taking a risk, and it was an exciting feeling early on that led to the album going down this path.\u201dThis path is one in which the best bits of the Band of Skulls who have established themselves as one of Britain\u2019s most exciting and successful rock\u2019n\u2019roll bands are meshed with something new. The result is an album that doesn\u2019t skimp on the force of overdriven guitars, but combines the sounds of a live band with electronic programming and the pop genius of producer Richard X (M.I.A., Goldfrapp, Sugababes, Pet Shop Boys) to create a record that sounds like a band reborn.That Band of Skulls was going to have to change was inevitable once drummer Matt Hayward told RIchardson and singer/guitarist Russell Marsden he was leaving the group at the end of 2016, once they had finished touring their fourth album, By Default. \u201cWe became a songwriting duo,\u201d Marsden says, \u201cwhich has a completely different feel to being a songwriting band. We didn\u2019t know what that felt like until it happened and it changed the dynamic of the creative process.\u201dInstead of three creative people in competition to push their ideas forward, Band of Skulls became more collaborative in their writing, with Richardson and Marsden bouncing ideas off each other from their respective home studios in Southampton through the first part of 2017, and embracing new ideas in their composition. \u201cWe started work using drum machines and different electronic ways to write,\u201d Richardson says. Marsden adds: \u201cWe're singers and guitar players, so getting our hands on in that department was exciting and challenging. That was the beginning of this. I think the record's feel is different because we had to wrangle it out of something.\u201dIn summer 2017 they teamed up with RIchard X for sporadic sessions at Miloco Studios in London, and set about the next phase. \u201cBy the end it was more of a collaboration than a traditional artist-producer relationship,\u201d Marsden says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t forced \u2013 it was very natural. And the best ideas won out.\u201d The duo then went back to their home studios for a second wave of writing that produced some of the album\u2019s standouts \u2013 We\u2019re Alive, the title track, and Cool Your Battles.But what they didn\u2019t have was a Band of Skulls record \u2013 they had a huge array of demos, and a load of electronic programming. The next step, in early 2018, was to go to Smokestack Studios in Nashville for live tracking, with Julian Dorio of Eagles of Death Metal filling in on drums. This wasn\u2019t to finish the record, but to bring out the second element of Love Is All You Love: the rock band.\u00a0\u201cWe took the tapes back to London, without anyone knowing what they were going to be,\u201d Marsden says. \u201cThere were some songs that had been really transformed in Nashville: Love Is All You Love got another level of soul with that human element, from not being so precise. And Sound of You really changed. Before it had a minimal electro drumkit, but Julian added something that really humanised it, and it an amazing subtlety that wasn\u2019t there before.\u201dThat was the traditional part of the production. \u201cEverything else was not traditional at all,\u201d Marsden says. \u201cBut it was important to us to have that layer in the record, and that live feel.\u201d But the real alchemy was yet to come.Back in the UK, the band teamed up again with Richard X (who hadn\u2019t come to Nashville) where they set about taking the three sets of elements they had accumulated \u2013 their home demos, their work at Miloco, and the Nashville band tracking sessions \u2013 and combining them into a coherent whole. \u201cIt started out as trial and error,\u201d Richardson says, \u201cand then it transformed into a fully-fledged idea of combining the live and electronic elements.\u201dRichard X is credited as a co-writer on four songs (Sound of You, Thanks a Lot, Gold, and That\u2019s My Trouble, which, oddly, is one of the album\u2019s most straightahead rock songs), but it was his input across all 10 songs that gave the album its bright, shiny, accessible sound.\u201cThat\u2019s totally down to him,\u201d Marsden says. \u201cWe\u2019re lofi by nature. Everything we brought to him was lofi \u2013 maybe uncomfortably lofi by his standards \u2013 so that was his challenge. We were distorting synths, and hiding huge modular synths under the basslines of some of the songs. Even in a rock song like That\u2019s My Trouble, the guitars are treated like synths \u2013 that\u2019s the way he conceived it. In the end, the final feel of a record is down to the producer, but there\u2019s an element that\u2019s always the band that stays relatively consistent.\u201dLyrically, Love Is All You Love is affected by our troubled times. \u201cIt influences you whether you like it or not,\u201d Richardson says. \u201cYou get affected by the fear of it all and that sense of powerlessness. But there was a concerted effort not to make a depressing record about it all, because I don\u2019t think anyone wants to hear a dark, depressing record about these times. We wanted to have that feeling of euphoria in song, because we weren\u2019t getting it anywhere.\u201dSo songs such as Cool Your Battles, Love Is All You Love and We\u2019re Alive are more about finding unity and shared humanity than howling into the existential void. \u201cWe\u2019re focussing on the positive,\u201d Richardson says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much, and people don\u2019t often focus on the positive. I think that\u2019s to our detriment sometimes. Music, as well as making you think, should entertain and uplift, as well as making a statement. It\u2019s supposed to make you feel something, and if you can make someone feel better about interacting with other people, that\u2019s a good thing.\u201dLove Is All You Love charts bold new ground for Band of Skulls: a tough rock\u2019n\u2019roll record with gleaming pop hooks; an album where melancholy and euphoria combine in equal measure. It\u2019s an album that points a way forward, something the band themselves recognise.\u201cIt's so important if you're working in any creative field to stop and look back and then put yourself under pressure to try something you've never done before, because usually that's when the best work comes, when you don't know what's going to happen next,\u201d Richardson says. \u201cIf you try something you haven't done, it reveals what you could do in the future. If you take risks, you come up with more ideas \u2013 things are flowing now, and we've already started writing the next album.\u201dFor now, though, Love Is All You Love is something to, well, love.Love Is All You Love is released April 12, 2019 on So Recordings", "html": "<P><STRONG>BAND OF SKULLS</STRONG></P><P><A HREF=\"https://twitter.com/bandofskulls\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Twitter</A>\u00a0I\u00a0<A HREF=\"https://www.facebook.com/bandofskulls/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Facebook</A>\u00a0I<A HREF=\"https://www.instagram.com/bandofskullsofficial/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">\u00a0Instagram</A></P><P><STRONG>About The Show</STRONG></P><P><EM>Doors: 7:30pm / Show: 8:30pm</EM></P><P><EM>Tickets on sale Friday 4/19 at 10am</EM></P><P>It takes only seconds of Band of Skulls\u2019 fifth album, Love Is All You Love, to realise that they are no longer the band you thought they were. Carnivorous begins with a fanfare of synths, which lead into a pounding, throbbing dancefloor bassline, an Arabesque lead guitar figure, and electronic percussion patterns \u2013 yet underneath it all there\u2019s still a blisteringly powerful rock\u2019n\u2019roll band. \u201cCarnivorous opened the window for the thought: What can we do now? What are we capable of?\u201d says bassist and singer Emma Richardson. \u201cIt was the first step towards taking a risk, and it was an exciting feeling early on that led to the album going down this path.\u201d</P><P>This path is one in which the best bits of the Band of Skulls who have established themselves as one of Britain\u2019s most exciting and successful rock\u2019n\u2019roll bands are meshed with something new. The result is an album that doesn\u2019t skimp on the force of overdriven guitars, but combines the sounds of a live band with electronic programming and the pop genius of producer Richard X (M.I.A., Goldfrapp, Sugababes, Pet Shop Boys) to create a record that sounds like a band reborn.</P><P>That Band of Skulls was going to have to change was inevitable once drummer Matt Hayward told RIchardson and singer/guitarist Russell Marsden he was leaving the group at the end of 2016, once they had finished touring their fourth album, By Default. \u201cWe became a songwriting duo,\u201d Marsden says, \u201cwhich has a completely different feel to being a songwriting band. We didn\u2019t know what that felt like until it happened and it changed the dynamic of the creative process.\u201d</P><P>Instead of three creative people in competition to push their ideas forward, Band of Skulls became more collaborative in their writing, with Richardson and Marsden bouncing ideas off each other from their respective home studios in Southampton through the first part of 2017, and embracing new ideas in their composition. \u201cWe started work using drum machines and different electronic ways to write,\u201d Richardson says. Marsden adds: \u201cWe're singers and guitar players, so getting our hands on in that department was exciting and challenging. That was the beginning of this. I think the record's feel is different because we had to wrangle it out of something.\u201d</P><P>In summer 2017 they teamed up with RIchard X for sporadic sessions at Miloco Studios in London, and set about the next phase. \u201cBy the end it was more of a collaboration than a traditional artist-producer relationship,\u201d Marsden says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t forced \u2013 it was very natural.
