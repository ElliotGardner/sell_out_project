Recorded entirely with solar and wind powered electricity on a nearly uninhabited, remote, off-grid island in northwest Washington state, McGraw and Fer have ventured into new territory, both geographically and artistically.\nMcGraw and Fer were invited to a seaside farm to care-take for four old donkeys and a flock of chickens for three months on a non-ferry serviced island with a winter population of fewer than eight people. Seizing the opportunity for a solitary writing residency, the duo loaded all of their instruments, minimal recording gear, and groceries into a tiny 16\u2019 aluminum boat and crossed the channel towards the US/Canadian border for what they called their \u2018feral\u2019 adventure. Pushing wheelbarrows full of provisions in their rubber boots, they made their way to a hand-built cabin where they recorded Off-Grid Lo-Fi in a living room overlooking the Pacific inland sea. The recording set-up was basic. No computer screens or editing. No Auto-Tune. All real takes. The result is a twelve-song album drenched with rich vocal harmonies, poignant songwriting, Fer\u2019s potent electric guitar playing, acoustic guitars, percussion, cello and newly prominent banjo and piano (all played bye Fer and McGraw). Off-Grid Lo-Fi is an intimate, authentic and refreshingly honest exploration into the genres of folk, rock, and roots music.\nKnown as a standout electric guitarist and multi-instrumentalist, Mandy Fer fills the stage with her strong yet poised guitar solos, defying long-held gender barriers for female lead guitarists. Dave McGraw\u2019s emotional songwriting riffs on natural elements of the world around him. McGraw spent a decade as a wildlife biologist, studying endangered birds in remote locales from the deserts of Mexico and the Grand Canyon to the mountainous rainforests of Washington. McGraw and Fer joined forces in Flagstaff, Arizona in 2010 before relocating to the Pacific Northwest in 2012.\nThe duo\u2019s 2014 release Maritime charted at #1 on the EuroAmericana Chart for two consecutive months and was praised by The Telegraph for \u201c\u2026soulful songs, intuitive musicianship, and fine singing.\u201d Together, their exceptional vocal harmonies coupled with Fer\u2019s pioneering electric guitar work have become a vehicle to carry them around the world. The pair has honed their skills touring extensively throughout the US and Europe, sharing stages with such artists as Iron & Wine, Glen Hansard, Gregory Alan Isakov, Charlie Hunter Trio, Lake Street Dive and many others. Winning over audiences anywhere from Alaska to Amsterdam, McGraw and Fer perform a heartfelt and dynamic blend of innovative folk, rock, pop and funk.\nWebsite\n\nRadio Free Honduras\nCharlie Baran has lived a life of music. Before moving the the United States he was a founding member of the legendary Honduran musical group Banda Blanca, who\u2019s song \u201cSopa de Caracol\u201d became the #1 Billboard Top Latin Songs hit in 1992. Now a maintenance man at a Catholic grade school by day, Charlie has kept his musical flame glowing largely through acoustic solo performances around Chicago for the past ten years.\nCharlie Baran is a true virtuoso. No one sees him perform without recognizing the presence of a true master \u2013 an heir to a rich tradition of Honduran music, as well as a guitar slinging showman and a gifted songwriter whose skill transcends all genres. But throughout most of his career he has existed in the shadows \u2013 until the formation of Radio Free Honduras.\nRadio Free Honduras is a diverse collective of Chicago musicians, all united under one goal \u2013 supporting the artistry of Charlie Baran and bringing this tremendous talent into the spotlight where it belongs. Founded by Dan Abu-Absi, longtime guitarist for JT and the Clouds and Birds of Chicago, Radio Free Honduras plays mostly Baran originals, but their live shows often feature a wide variety of reimagined cover songs. This band provides Charlie with the wide musical pallet his talent (and songs) deserve. Abu-Absi has gathered a large, revolving collective of some of Chicago\u2019s most talented musicians; lively percussion, eclectic instrumentation, and rich harmonies all provide the backdrop, allowing Charlie to do what he does best \u2013 stunning guitar work, tapping into what seems a limitless supply of energy and enthusiasm for music.\nCharlie Baran has lived a long and storied musical life \u2013 but very few are familiar with his side of the story. Radio Free Honduras has made it their mission to change that.\nWebsite\n\u00a0\nFAQs\nPlease click here for a detailed FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

Founded by Dan Abu-Absi, longtime guitarist for JT and the Clouds and Birds of Chicago, Radio Free Honduras plays mostly Baran originals, but their live shows often feature a wide variety of reimagined cover songs. This band provides Charlie with the wide musical pallet his talent (and songs) deserve. Abu-Absi has gathered a large, revolving collective of some of Chicago\u2019s most talented musicians; lively percussion, eclectic instrumentation, and rich harmonies all provide the backdrop, allowing Charlie to do what he does best \u2013 stunning guitar work, tapping into what seems a limitless supply of energy and enthusiasm for music.</P>\n<P>Charlie Baran has lived a long and storied musical life \u2013 but very few are familiar with his side of the story. Radio Free Honduras has made it their mission to change that.</P>\n<P><A HREF=\"http://radiofreehonduras.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Website</A></P>\n<P>\u00a0</P>\n<H2><STRONG>FAQs</STRONG></H2>\n<P><STRONG>Please click <A HREF=\"http://evanstonspace.com/faq\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</A> for a detailed FAQ.</STRONG></P>\n<P><STRONG>Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0</STRONG>Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

The brilliant band created by Eric and led by Lazer Lloyd produced music that is sheer heaven. To complete the album, Lazer found inspiration in the red dirt of Oklahoma and Texas working with many times Grammy nominated Chris Bell (Don Henley, Eagles, Erykah Badu, Luther Dickinson, Eric Johnson etc) at Billy Crockett\u2019s Blue Rock Studios in Wimberley with a group of young Tulsa musicians. The sound achieved by Chris is warm and real and soul transforming.\nAlso on the album is Lazer's hit Americana anthem \"Backstreets\" which took off as a single in 2018. Produced by wizard of sound, Vic Steffens at his at Horizon Studio in West Haven, CT. The song went on to pass a million streams on Spotify, going viral on Facebook and Youtube and winning the admiration of Texas veteran DJs Mama T and Ken Murray (video). Lazer's powerful vocal and acoustic guitar playing was recorded in one take with no edits or overdubs and shines a spotlight on this artist's talent as a singer-songwriter as well as a guitarist beloved for his solos and instrumental pieces around the world - such as Tears for Dikla and Esquecas do Mundo (Forget the World).\nAs Lazer's previous album \"Freedom's Child\" was shooting up the Americana chart and \u201cBackstreets\u201d was going viral as a single, Lloyd was already on to the next project - recording an album with Eric Paul (Willie Nelson, Townes Van Zandt, Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson etc) at Ricky Skaggs Studio in Nashville featuring (Michael Rojas on keyboards, Michael Spriggs on rhythm guitar, Eddie Bayers on drums, and bass players Mark Fain and Eli Beaird).

The North Carolina duo have built a steady and growing fanbase with this kind of intimacy, and on Tides of A Teardrop, due out February 1, it is more potent than ever. By all accounts, it is the duo\u2019s fullest, richest, and most personal effort. You can hear the air between them\u2014the taut space of shared understanding, as palpable as a magnetic field, that makes their music sound like two halves of an endlessly completing thought. Singer-songwriter Andrew Marlin and multiinstrumentalist Emily Frantz have honed this lamp glow intimacy for years.\nOn Tides of A Teardrop, Marlin wrote the songs, as he usually does, in a sort of stream of consciousness, allowing words and phrases to pour out of him as he hunted for the chords and melodies. Then, as he went back to sharpen what he found, he found something troubling and profound. Intimations of loss have always haunted the edges of their music, their lyrics hinting at impermanence and passing of time. But Tides of A Teardrop confronts a defining loss head-on: Marlin's mother, who died of complications from surgery when he was 18.\nThese songs, as well as their sentiments, remain simple and quiet, like all of their music. But beneath the hushed surface, they are staggeringly straightforward. \u201cI\u2019ve been holding on to the grief for a long time. In some ways I associated the grief and the loss with remembering my mom. I feel like I\u2019ve mourned long enough. I\u2019m ready to bring forth some happier memories now, to just remember her as a living being.\"\nFor this album, Marlin and Frantz enlisted their touring band, who they also worked with on their last album Blindfaller. Having recorded all previous albums live in the studio, they approached the recording process in a different way this time. \u201cWe went and did what most people do, which we\u2019ve never done before\u2014we just holed up somewhere and worked the tunes out together,\u201d Frantz says. There is a telepathy and warmth in the interplay on Tides of A Teardrop that brings a new dynamic to the foreground\u2014that holy silence between notes, the air that charges the album with such profound intimacy. \u201cThis record is a little more cosmic, almost in a spiritual way\u2014the space between the notes was there to suggest all those empty spaces the record touches on,\u201d acknowledges Marlin. There are many powerful ways of acknowledging loss; sometimes the most powerful one is saying nothing at all.\nWebsite\n\nI'M WITH HER (Sara Watkins, Sarah Jarosz and Aoife O\u2019Donovan):\u00a0\nI\u2019m With Her is a band rooted in a rare alchemy: three celebrated songwriters coming together to create music that reveals entirely new possibilities in their distinct and deep-seated talents. Since forming in 2014, Sara Watkins, Sarah Jarosz, and Aoife O\u2019Donovan have imbued their songs with a sharply detailed lyricism, graceful musicianship, and\u2014perhaps most powerfully\u2014mesmerizing harmonies that endlessly reflect their extraordinary chemistry.\nThe latest single from I\u2019m With Her, \u201cCall My Name\u201d again shows the strength and vitality of their singular connection. In a departure from the deliberately insular making of their debut album See You Around, the band pursued a new creative approach centered on true collaboration with producer Mike Elizondo (Regina Spektor, Fiona Apple). Recorded at Sound Emporium Studios in Nashville, \u201cCall My Name\u201d finds Elizondo building a hypnotic sonic backdrop, matching the track\u2019s quietly urgent beat with I\u2019m With Her\u2019s delicate interplay of guitar, Wurlitzer, and fiddle. The result is a song both stark and luminous, perfectly capturing the potent tension within even the most loving relationship.\nAfter years of crossing paths in their intersecting music scenes, Watkins, Jarosz, and O\u2019Donovan founded I\u2019m With Her following an impromptu gig at the Sheridan Opera House in Telluride. Over the coming years they began playing shows and festivals around the world, in addition to taking time out for a number of intensely focused writing sessions (including eight days spent in purposeful seclusion at a borrowed Vermont farmhouse). Arriving in early 2018, See You Around quickly drew critical acclaim and ultimately graced best-of-the-year lists from leading outlets like the New York Times, NPR Music, and Paste.\nAlong with See You Around, 2018 saw the release of multiple singles from I\u2019m With Her, including a remix by Tune-Yards of \u201cGame to Lose,\u201d a rendition of Adele\u2019s \u201cSend My Love (To Your New Lover),\u201d and a Spotify Session featuring their version of Vampire Weekend\u2019s \u201cHannah Hunt\u201d (a cover that fast became a fan favorite at shows). Nominated for Duo/Group of the Year by the Americana Music Association and Artist of the Year at the International Folk Music Awards, the band has also taken the stage on late-night shows like Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Last Call with Carson Daly. With upcoming U.S. performances including the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, House of Blues in Boston, The Kennedy Center in Washington DC, and Red Rocks Ampitheatre in Colorado, I\u2019m With Her will soon return to Europe as well as make their debut across Australia.\nWebsite", "html": "<H2><STRONG>OUT OF SPACE 2019:\u00a0MANDOLIN ORANGE &amp; I'M WITH HER\u00a0</STRONG></H2>\n<H2><STRONG></STRONG><EM>presented by SPACE and Old Town School of Folk Music at Canal Shores Golf Course</EM></H2>\n<P><EM>Tickets\u00a0 go on-sale to the general public Fri, Apr 12, at 10am CST.</EM></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<H2>ABOUT THE SHOW</H2>\n<H3><STRONG>GATES</STRONG>: 5pm\u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0<STRONG>I'M WITH HER: </STRONG>7pm\u00a0 |\u00a0 MANDOLIN ORANGE: 8:40PM</H3>\n<P>Canal Shores is located at 1030 Central Street in Evanston, IL.\u00a0</P>\n<P><SPAN>Please click\u00a0</SPAN><A HREF=\"https://www.spacepresents.com/faq-canal-shores\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">HERE</A><SPAN>\u00a0for a detailed FAQ.</SPAN></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<H2><SPAN>ABOUT THE ARTISTS<BR></SPAN></H2>\n<P><STRONG>Genre: </STRONG>Folk</P>\n<P><STRONG>MANDOLIN ORANGE:\u00a0</STRONG>Mandolin Orange\u2019s music radiates a mysterious warmth \u2014their songs feel like whispered secrets, one hand cupped to your ear.

SHOW\nGATES: 5pm\u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0OHMME: 7pm\u00a0 |\u00a0 JEFF TWEEDY: 8:15PM\nCanal Shores is located at 1030 Central Street in Evanston, IL.\u00a0\nPlease click\u00a0HERE\u00a0for a detailed FAQ.\n\nABOUT THE ARTISTS\nGenre: Alt-rock\nTWEEDY\nJeff Tweedy is \u201cone of the most daring songwriters of his generation\u201d and his band Wilco is \u201cvital, adventurous . . . breaking new stylistic ground with each ambitious and creatively restless album\u201d \u2013 Salon.com.\nAs the founding member and leader of the American rock band Wilco and before that the co-founder of the alt-country band Uncle Tupelo, Jeff Tweedy is one of contemporary American music\u2019s most accomplished songwriters, musicians and performers. Since starting Wilco in 1994 Tweedy has written original songs for eight Wilco albums and collaborated with folk singer Billy Bragg to bring musical life to three albums-full of Woody Guthrie-penned lyrics in the Mermaid Avenue series.\nHis latest project is Tweedy, a musical collaboration with his 18-year-old son and drummer Spencer Tweedy. The father/son duo\u2019s debut album is called Sukierae and features 20 songs written by Jeff Tweedy. With Spencer on drums, Jeff handles his usual guitars and vocals, as well as bass and keyboards. Musician Scott McCaughey (R.E.M., The Minus Five, The Baseball Project) lends additional keyboards and backing vocals on Sukierae come courtesy of Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig of the Brooklyn-band Lucius.\n\u201cWhen I set out to make this record, I imagined it being a solo thing, but not in the sense of one guy strumming an acoustic guitar and singing,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cSolo to me meant that I would do everything \u2013 write the songs, play all the instruments and sing. But Spencer\u2019s been with me from the very beginning demo sessions, playing drums and helping the songs take shape. In that sense, the record is kind of like a solo album performed by a duo.\u201d\nTweedy\u2019s touring band includes Spencer on drums plus bassist Darin Grey, guitarist Jim Elkington and keyboardist Liam Cunningham.\nAlso an accomplished and in-demand producer beyond the Wilco and Tweedy realm, Jeff has collaborated twice with soul and gospel legend Mavis Staples. First on her 2010 release You Are Not Alone, and on 2012\u2019s One True Vine. Both albums were produced by Jeff and recorded at the Wilco loft and both have garnered widespread critical acclaim.\n\u201cOne True Vine sounds at once contemporary and true to Staples\u2019 lengthy career and history\u2026 haunting, beautifully restrained\u2026\u201d \u2013 The A.V. Club. \u201c\nBest Americana Album in the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards. Jeff Tweedy\u2019s producer credits also include The Invisible Way by the Minneapolis trio Low, Wassaic Way by folk-rock duo Sarah Lee Guthrie & Johnny Irion\u2019s (co-produced production of Wilco\u2019s Jeff Tweedy\u2026 mixes triumphant gospel and evocative blues, Guided by the brilliant infusing each with hard-won wisdom\u201d -NPR on You Are Not Alone. The album went on to win with Wilco\u2019s Patrick Sansone). Additionally, he\u2019s done production work with Austin\u2019s psychedelic rockers White Denim.\nA touring tour-de-force Tweedy and Wilco have played more than 1,500 concerts worldwide. Wilco also mans the helm at its own Solid Sound Festival at MASS MoCA in The Berkshires in Western Massachusetts \u2013 a three-day event blending music, comedy, world-class contemporary art and more.\nWebsite\n\nOHMME:\u00a0Already celebrated as the \u201cHeart of Chicago\u2019s Music Community\u201d (Noisey) by both fans and tastemakers alike, OHMME (aka the duo of Sima Cunningham and Macie Stewart) amalgamate the aggressive and the meditative on their bold debut full-length album, Parts.\nStill in their 20s, Stewart and Cunningham are both classically trained musicians and are established players within the Chicago music scene. They are especially involved in performing and working for venues within the local experimental music scene. They\u2019re constant collaborators and have recorded and toured with homegrown acts as varied as Tweedy, Whitney, Chance The Rapper and Twin Peaks.\nCunningham and Stewart are multi-instrumentalist, singer-songwriters with a penchant for two instruments in particular. \"The band started because we knew we could sing well together and we wanted to make some noise with the guitar,\u201d says Cunningham.

Since starting Wilco in 1994 Tweedy has written original songs for eight Wilco albums and collaborated with folk singer Billy Bragg to bring musical life to three albums-full of Woody Guthrie-penned lyrics in the Mermaid Avenue series.</P>\n<P>His latest project is Tweedy, a musical collaboration with his 18-year-old son and drummer Spencer Tweedy. The father/son duo\u2019s debut album is called Sukierae and features 20 songs written by Jeff Tweedy. With Spencer on drums, Jeff handles his usual guitars and vocals, as well as bass and keyboards. Musician Scott McCaughey (R.E.M., The Minus Five, The Baseball Project) lends additional keyboards and backing vocals on Sukierae come courtesy of Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig of the Brooklyn-band Lucius.</P>\n<P>\u201cWhen I set out to make this record, I imagined it being a solo thing, but not in the sense of one guy strumming an acoustic guitar and singing,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cSolo to me meant that I would do everything \u2013 write the songs, play all the instruments and sing. But Spencer\u2019s been with me from the very beginning demo sessions, playing drums and helping the songs take shape. In that sense, the record is kind of like a solo album performed by a duo.\u201d</P>\n<P>Tweedy\u2019s touring band includes Spencer on drums plus bassist Darin Grey, guitarist Jim Elkington and keyboardist Liam Cunningham.</P>\n<P>Also an accomplished and in-demand producer beyond the Wilco and Tweedy realm, Jeff has collaborated twice with soul and gospel legend Mavis Staples. First on her 2010 release You Are Not Alone, and on 2012\u2019s One True Vine. Both albums were produced by Jeff and recorded at the Wilco loft and both have garnered widespread critical acclaim.</P>\n<P>\u201cOne True Vine sounds at once contemporary and true to Staples\u2019 lengthy career and history\u2026 haunting, beautifully restrained\u2026\u201d \u2013 The A.V. Club. \u201c</P>\n<P>Best Americana Album in the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards. Jeff Tweedy\u2019s producer credits also include The Invisible Way by the Minneapolis trio Low, Wassaic Way by folk-rock duo Sarah Lee Guthrie &amp; Johnny Irion\u2019s (co-produced production of Wilco\u2019s Jeff Tweedy\u2026 mixes triumphant gospel and evocative blues, Guided by the brilliant infusing each with hard-won wisdom\u201d -NPR on You Are Not Alone. The album went on to win with Wilco\u2019s Patrick Sansone). Additionally, he\u2019s done production work with Austin\u2019s psychedelic rockers White Denim.</P>\n<P>A touring tour-de-force Tweedy and Wilco have played more than 1,500 concerts worldwide. Wilco also mans the helm at its own Solid Sound Festival at MASS MoCA in The Berkshires in Western Massachusetts \u2013 a three-day event blending music, comedy, world-class contemporary art and more.</P>\n<P><A HREF=\"https://wilcoworld.net/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Website</A></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P><STRONG>OHMME:\u00a0</STRONG>Already celebrated as the \u201cHeart of Chicago\u2019s Music Community\u201d (Noisey) by both fans and tastemakers alike, OHMME (aka the duo of Sima Cunningham and Macie Stewart) amalgamate the aggressive and the meditative on their bold debut full-length album, Parts.</P>\n<P>Still in their 20s, Stewart and Cunningham are both classically trained musicians and are established players within the Chicago music scene. They are especially involved in performing and working for venues within the local experimental music scene. They\u2019re constant collaborators and have recorded and toured with homegrown acts as varied as Tweedy, Whitney, Chance The Rapper and Twin Peaks.</P>\n<P>Cunningham and Stewart are multi-instrumentalist, singer-songwriters with a penchant for two instruments in particular. \"The band started because we knew we could sing well together and we wanted to make some noise with the guitar,\u201d says Cunningham.

Her maid Finette is having an affair with a clarinetist reduced to playing in the Cirque Fernando band, Pistache. After a performance, Bagatelle is rehearsing a peasant song when an 18-year-old young admirer enters through the window. He is Georges de Planteville and to ensure they stay together he throws the keys through the window. However Pistache had been hidden in the apartment also; in the morning Finette has to release all three.

He became a global name in music by reimagining American roots forms as songs that moved with the atmospheric grace of jazz. \u201cThe Way It Is\u201d defined sonic joy on the radio, however as a hit record it also evidenced a thrilling re-structuring, and during the years afterward Hornsby, in staggeringly diverse ways, has kept going.\nHe has returned to traditional American roots forms, collaborating with Ricky Skaggs. He has played with the Grateful Dead. He has fused the plunk and dazzle of twentieth-century modernist classical composition to singer-songwriter emotional inquiries. He has scored films. He has performed with symphony orchestras. If the sound of an arrogant air-conditioner or a stretch of rude playing caught his ear, he has entered the hallowed doors of the conservatories of punk. So when Hornsby describes Absolute Zero, his new album, as \u201ca compendium of what I like and moves me,\u201d don\u2019t expect perhaps a thing or two new. Prepare for a multi- faceted ride.\nA few years ago, Hornsby met Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. \u201cI kept getting these Google Alerts where he shouted me out in the press,\u201d Hornsby says. In time, other musicians praised Hornsby\u2019s work -- including Brandon Flowers, who asked him to play on his solo album. In the indie-rock zeitgeist, Bruce Hornsby became a thing.\nAfter Hornsby began working with Vernon, the Wisconsinite invited Hornsby to perform at his Eaux Claires Music and Arts Festival. \u201cI\u2019d played a thousand-and- one festivals over the years,\u201d Hornsby says. \u201cThis one was by far the most beautiful experience for me. They had a modern classical stage where you could hear Frederic Rzewski pieces. Everything was artful and beautiful, so great.\u201d\nBefore Hornsby played, The Staves and yMusic appeared. \u201cSo I\u2019m listening to this British female vocal trio and Brooklyn chamber music group, going \u2018Whoa, who is this?\u201d\u201d Hornsby says. \u201cI loved the women, the chamber music group, the whole thing. What they were doing together was adventurous, a different sound.\u201d\nHornsby\u2019s discoveries that evening ultimately circled back to Williamsburg, where over the last years he has hosted his own festival. After Eaux Claires, Hornsby invited yMusic and The Staves to appear at the Williamsburg event. \u201cThat\u2019s when I met them,\u201d he says. \u201cWe hit it off and became friends. I asked them to play on what became Absolute Zero. We did a session with yMusic in New York. We worked on six pieces; five ended up on the record. It just went from there. Music\u2019s leader Rob Moose started doing some things on his own on some new songs that I would write. Rob arranging on his own \u2013 where he puts down twenty different string parts (\u2018Give me another one! OK, there\u2019s that. Another track! Another track!\u2019) \u2013 is quite something to see, working his magic in the studio.\u201d The genesis of Absolute Zero, however, began within Hornsby\u2019s work as a film composer for writer-director Spike Lee. Hornsby started collaborating with Lee in 1992; ultimately, in 2008, he began scoring for Lee. Since then Hornsby has written six full film scores and contributed incidental music to four others. What began to intrigue him were scoring components known as \u201ccues,\u201d those comparatively brief passages of music used in films to heighten certain narrative visuals and/or spoken developments.\n\u201cOver the past decade I\u2019ve written fully 230 different cues,\u201d Hornsby says, \u201cranging from one to five minutes in length. Through the last ten years of doing this there always were certain cues that sounded like they wanted to be songs, wanted to be developed into something more than just cues, more than just tiny instrumentals setting moods for conversations in a film over dinner, or whatever.\u201d He asked his engineer to make a file of fourteen. Hornsby began working with these Lee cues -- lengthening or shortening or repeating them. \u201cYou sculpt and shape the music accordingly,\u201d Hornsby says, \u201c based on the new information you\u2019ve created over top of these cues.\u201d\nThen there was the creation of the songs\u2019 lyrics. \u201cFor many years, \u201cHornsby says, \u201cI\u2019ve been interested in literary fiction.\u201d Even in 2019, when literary fiction exists alongside other types of novels and stories, it remains an extensively chronicled and robustly debated kind of writing. Although it was published centuries before rock and roll exploded, literary fiction shares certain values \u2013 constant critical scrutiny, for example, as well as absolute freedom on the part of practitioners, even when that sometimes yields some mighty uneasy reading -- with indie-rock. Literary fiction can show up on best-seller lists, just like indie-rock occasionally storms charts.\n\u201cLike many readers do,\u201d Hornsby says, \u201cI\u2019d dog-ear a page or mark something I thought was well-said, some amazing description of a thimble, say. So I began to think about what for me were the most memorable passages I\u2019d encountered from my reading, the good bits from two writers admire greatly, Don DeLillo and the late David Foster Wallace. On this record, those are my two literary inspirations and guides, Don and Dave.\u201d Hornsby\u2019s songs, both in spirit and memory, function collectively as an hommage to fiction writing that, while often poetic, takes no prisoners.\nReady for the results? Those would be pieces like the opening title track -- which features drumming by the legendary Jack DeJohnette -- inspired by DeLillo\u2019s Zero K, a book Hornsby describes as about \u201cthe cryonic field \u2013 or, most baldly put, Ted Williams freezing in a vault somewhere outside Phoenix.\u201d Or \u201cFractals,\u201d wherein Hornsby compares a relationship with that \u201crough and fragmented geometrical shape,\u201d as he puts it, \u201cthat can be subdivided into parts.\u201d Or \u201cEcholocation,\u201d a stylistic cousin of \u201cFractals,\u201d that Hornsby calls \u201cone of my musical combines.\u201d He\u2019s remembering the American artist and pop art instigator Robert Rauschenberg, who during the 1950s made famous hybrids of tactile painting and sculpture, where almost anything, assembled just so rightly, goes.\n\u201cThat aspect of found materials,\u201d Hornsby says, \u201ccollages: That\u2019s exactly what my new album is on a musical level. You go into my studio and there\u2019s just crap everywhere \u2013 a vibraslap here, a train whistle there, a crappy old violin I\u2019m playing badly. And then there\u2019s my brother playing some dog-shitty violin that\u2019s vibey as hell.\u201d\nHornsby produced Absolute Zero, his pastiche of sounds\u201d as it calls the album, with assists from Tony Berg, Vernon, and Brad Cook. Some songs, like \u201cNever in This House,\u201d expose traditional Hornsby songwriting semi-nakedly; others, like \u201cVoyager One\u201d \u2013 \u201csort of chamber art-pop meets Prince,\u201d Hornsby says \u2013 and \u201cThe Blinding Light of Dreams\u201d \u2013 with a groove that Hornsby points out dates back to \u201cSerpentine Fire\u201d by Earth, Wind & Fire \u2013 re-stage U.S. r&b as fluidly as the music elsewhere refers to an American modernist composer like Elliott Carter. \u201cMeds,\u201d for example, a particular tour de force of Hornsby/Moose featuring special guitar by Blake Mills, blossoms into gripping \u201860s soul choruses. \u201cCast Off\u201d manages to animate a rare style \u2013 miserablist polyrhythms \u2013 without skimping on the funk itself.\n\u201cWhite Noise\u201d Hornsby considers \u201cthe Wallace moment.\u201d It offers a passionate singer with a string quartet backing him. \u201cThe narrative comes from Wallace\u2019s The Pale King,\u201d Hornsby says, \u201ca novel about boredom, about IRS tax examiners as unlikely yet convincing American heroes.\u201d And then \u201cTake You There (Misty),\u201d written with Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter, concludes the sequence with romanticism as re-ordered by Hornsby via memories of Steve Reich\u2019s and Philip Glass\u2019s sonically floral minimalism.\nA ride. There is precedent for musical artists moving from the mainstream of popular music to...somewhere else: Ohio-born Scott Walker, ruling the airwaves with The Walker Brothers in early-\u201860s Britain, then concocting uniquely dark- toned symphonic solo albums followed by uncharted lands of vocal compositions even much bleaker. David Byrne, determined that the late-70s downtown Manhattan freedom of Talking Heads expand to include pop styles all over the known universe. Robbie Williams, absolutely dead-set on not letting his \u201890s boy- band years preclude pop and rock and swing styles done with uncommon erudition.\nThis stripe of music evolution over time clearly has another member to add to its small and restless club. It\u2019s Bruce Hornsby, a great restructuralist from the beginning and onward. Absolute Zero constitutes absolute 2019 proof. And all you need to hear it is a set of open ears.\nWebsite\n\nSUZANNE VEGA:\u00a0Widely regarded as one of the most brilliant songwriters of her generation, Suzanne Vega emerged as a leading figure of the folk-music revival of the early 1980s when, accompanying herself on acoustic guitar, she sang what has been labeled contemporary folk or neo-folk songs of her own creation in Greenwich Village clubs. Since the release of her self-titled, critically acclaimed 1985 debut album, she has given sold-out concerts in many of the world's best-known halls. In performances devoid of outward drama that nevertheless convey deep emotion, Vega sings in a distinctive, clear vibrato-less voice that has been described as \"a cool, dry sandpaper- brushed near-whisper\" and as \"plaintive but disarmingly powerful.\"\nBearing the stamp of a masterful storyteller who \"observed the world with a clinically poetic eye,\" Suzanne's songs have always tended to focus on city life, ordinary people and real world subjects. Notably succinct and understated, often cerebral but also streetwise, her lyrics invite multiple interpretations. In short, Suzanne Vega's work is immediately recognizable, as utterly distinct and thoughtful, and as creative and musical now, as it was when her voice was first heard on the radio over 20 years ago.\nSuzanne was born in Santa Monica, CA, but grew up in Spanish Harlem and the Upper West Side of New York City. She was influenced by her mother, a computer systems analyst and her stepfather, the Puerto Rican writer Egardo Vega Yunque. There was a heady mix of multicultural music playing at home: Motown, bossa nova, jazz and folk. At age 11 she picked up a guitar and as a teenager she started to write songs.\nSuzanne studied dance at the High School for the Performing Arts and later attended Barnard College where she majored in English Literature. It was in 1979 when Suzanne attended a concert by Lou Reed and began to find her true artistic voice and distinctive vision for contemporary folk. Receptionist by day, Suzanne was hanging out at the Greenwich Village Songwriter's Exchange by night. Soon she was playing iconic venues like The Bottom Line and Folk City. The word was out and audiences were catching on.\nAt first, record companies saw little prospect of commercial success. Suzanne's demo tape was rejected by every major record company -- and twice by the very label that eventually signed her: A&M Records. Her self-titled debut album was finally released in 1985, co-produced by Steve Addabbo and Lenny Kaye, the former guitarist for Patti Smith. The skeptical executives at A&M were expecting to sell 30,000 LPs. 1,000,000 records later, it was clear that Suzanne's voice was resonating around the world. \"Marlene on the Wall\" was a surprise hit in the U.K and Rolling Stone eventually included the record in their \"100 Greatest Recordings of the 1980s.\" 1987's follow up, Solitude Standing, again co-produced by Addabbo and Kaye, elevated her to star status. The album hit #2 in the UK and #11 in the States, was nominated for three Grammys including Record of the Year, and went platinum. \"Luka\" is a song that has entered the cultural vernacular; certainly the only hit song ever written from the perspective of an abused boy.\nThe opening song on Solitude Standing was a strange little a cappella piece, \"Tom's Diner\" about a non-descript restaurant near Columbia University uptown. Without Suzanne's permission, it was remixed by U.K. electronic dance duo DNA and bootlegged as \"Oh Susanne.\" Suddenly her voice on this obscure tune was showing up in the most unlikely setting of all: the club. Suzanne permitted an official release of the remix of \"Tom's Diner\" under its original title, which reached #5 on the Billboard pop chart and went gold. In 1991 a compilation, Tom's Album, brought together the remix and other unsolicited versions of the song. Meanwhile, Karlheinz Brandenburg, the German computer programmer, was busy developing the technology that would come to be known as the MP3. He found that Vega's voice was the perfect template with which to test the purity of the audio compression that he was aiming to perfect. Thus Suzanne earned the nickname \"The Mother of the MP3.\"\nSuzanne co-produced the follow-up album with Anton Sanko, 1990's Days Of Open Hand, which won a Grammy for Best Album Package. The album also featured a string arrangement by minimalist composer Philip Glass. Years earlier she had penned lyrics for his song cycle \"Songs From Liquid Days.\" Continuing to battle preconceptions, she teamed with producer Mitchell Froom for 1992's 99.9F. The album's sound instigated descriptions such as \"industrial folk\" and \"technofolk.\" Certified gold, 99.9F won a New York Music Award as Best Rock Album. Suzanne's neo-folk style has ushered in a new female, acoustic, folk-pop singer-songwriter movement that would include the likes of Tracy Chapman, Shawn Colvin, and Indigo Girls. In 1997, Suzanne joined Sarah McLachlan on her Lilith Fair tour, which celebrated the female voice in rock and pop. She was one of the few artists invited back every year. Suzanne was also the host of the public radio series \"American Mavericks,\" thirteen hour-long programs featuring the histories and the music of the iconoclastic, contemporary classical composers who revolutionized the possibilities of new music. The show won the Peabody Award for Excellence in Broadcasting.\nIn 1996, Vega returned with the similarly audacious Nine Objects Of Desire, also produced by Mitchell Froom, who by then was her husband. \"Woman On The Tier (I'll See You Through)\" was released on the \"Dead Man Walking\" soundtrack. Over the years, she has also been heard on the soundtracks to \"Pretty In Pink\" (\"Left Of Center\" with Joe Jackson) and \"The Truth About Cats & Dogs,\" and contributed to such diverse projects as the Disney compilation Stay Awake, Grateful Dead tribute Deadicated, Leonard Cohen tribute Tower Of Song, and Pavarotti & Friends. In 1999, \"The Passionate Eye: The Collected Writings Of Suzanne Vega,\" a volume of poems, lyrics, essays and journalistic pieces, was published by Spike/Avon Books. In 2001, she returned to her acoustic roots for her first new album in five years, the critics' favorite Songs In Red And Gray.\nIn 2007, Suzanne released Beauty & Crime on Blue Note Records, a deeply personal reflection of her native New York City in the wake of the loss of her brother Tim and the tragedy of 9/11. But the record is not a sad one, per se, as her love for the city shines through as both its subject and its setting. In it, Suzanne mixes the past and present, the public with the private, and familiar sounds with the utterly new, just like the city itself. \"Anniversary,\" which concludes Beauty & Crime, is an understated evocation of that time in the fall of 2002, when New Yorkers first commemorated the Twin Towers tragedy and when Suzanne recalls her brother's passing. It's more inspiration than elegy, though: \"Make time for all your possibilities,\" Vega sings at the end in that beautiful, hushed voice. \"They live on every street.\" Produced by the Scotsman, Jimmy Hogarth and featuring songs such as \"New York is a Woman\" and \"Ludlow Street,\" Beauty & Crime is that rare album by an artist in her third decade; an album that is as original and startling as her first. Beauty & Crime won a Grammy for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical.\nIn 2006, she became the first major recording artist to perform live in avatar form within the virtual world Second Life. She has dedicated much of her time and energy to charitable causes, notably Amnesty International, Casa Alianza, and the Save Darfur Coalition. Suzanne has a daughter, Ruby, by first husband Mitchell Froom. Ruby, like Suzanne before her, attends the High School for the Performing Arts. Suzanne is married to lawyer/poet Paul Mills, who proposed to her originally in 1983. Suzanne accepted his proposal on Christmas Day 2005, twenty-two years later.\nSuzanne Vega is an artist that continues to surprise. In 2011 in New York City she premiered \"Carson McCullers Talks About Love,\" an original play written and performed by Ms. Vega with songs she wrote with Tony Award-winner Duncan Sheik (\"Spring Awakening\"). A pioneer among singer-songwriters. Suzanne has also embarked on a project to re-imagine her own songbook in a stripped down and intimate manner, creating four new thematic albums that will be released over the course of 2010-2012 called the Close-Up series.\nMs. Vega continues to tour constantly, having just played dates with artists as diverse as Moby and Bob Dylan. Suzanne is planning US and European dates this spring and summer.\nWebsite", "html": "<H2><STRONG>OUT OF SPACE 2019:\u00a0BRUCE HORNSBY</STRONG></H2>\n<H3><STRONG>&amp; THE NOISEMAKERS w/ SUZANNE VEGA</STRONG></H3>\n<H2><STRONG></STRONG><EM>presented by SPACE at Canal Shores Golf Course</EM></H2>\n<P><EM>Tickets\u00a0 go on-sale to the general public Fri, Apr 12, at 10am CST.</EM></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<H2>ABOUT THE SHOW</H2>\n<H3><STRONG>GATES</STRONG>: 5pm\u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0SUZANNE VEGA<STRONG>: 6:30</STRONG>pm\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0BRUCE HORNSBY: 8pm</H3>\n<P>Canal Shores is located at 1030 Central Street in Evanston, IL.\u00a0</P>\n<P><SPAN>Please click\u00a0</SPAN><A HREF=\"https://www.spacepresents.com/faq-canal-shores\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">HERE</A><SPAN>\u00a0for a detailed FAQ.</SPAN></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<H2><SPAN>ABOUT THE ARTIST</SPAN></H2>\n<P><STRONG>BRUCE HORNSBY:\u00a0\u00a0</STRONG>Bruce Hornsby, the creatively insatiable pianist and singer-songwriter from Williamsburg, Virginia, always has succeeded on his exceptional gifts, his training, and his work ethic. He became a global name in music by reimagining American roots forms as songs that moved with the atmospheric grace of jazz. \u201cThe Way It Is\u201d defined sonic joy on the radio, however as a hit record it also evidenced a thrilling re-structuring, and during the years afterward Hornsby, in staggeringly diverse ways, has kept going.</P>\n<P>He has returned to traditional American roots forms, collaborating with Ricky Skaggs. He has played with the Grateful Dead. He has fused the plunk and dazzle of twentieth-century modernist classical composition to singer-songwriter emotional inquiries. He has scored films. He has performed with symphony orchestras. If the sound of an arrogant air-conditioner or a stretch of rude playing caught his ear, he has entered the hallowed doors of the conservatories of punk. So when Hornsby describes Absolute Zero, his new album, as \u201ca compendium of what I like and moves me,\u201d don\u2019t expect perhaps a thing or two new. Prepare for a multi- faceted ride.</P>\n<P>A few years ago, Hornsby met Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. \u201cI kept getting these Google Alerts where he shouted me out in the press,\u201d Hornsby says. In time, other musicians praised Hornsby\u2019s work -- including Brandon Flowers, who asked him to play on his solo album. In the indie-rock zeitgeist, Bruce Hornsby became a thing.</P>\n<P>After Hornsby began working with Vernon, the Wisconsinite invited Hornsby to perform at his Eaux Claires Music and Arts Festival. \u201cI\u2019d played a thousand-and- one festivals over the years,\u201d Hornsby says. \u201cThis one was by far the most beautiful experience for me. They had a modern classical stage where you could hear Frederic Rzewski pieces. Everything was artful and beautiful, so great.\u201d</P>\n<P>Before Hornsby played, The Staves and yMusic appeared. \u201cSo I\u2019m listening to this British female vocal trio and Brooklyn chamber music group, going \u2018Whoa, who is this?\u201d\u201d Hornsby says. \u201cI loved the women, the chamber music group, the whole thing. What they were doing together was adventurous, a different sound.\u201d</P>\n<P>Hornsby\u2019s discoveries that evening ultimately circled back to Williamsburg, where over the last years he has hosted his own festival. After Eaux Claires, Hornsby invited yMusic and The Staves to appear at the Williamsburg event. \u201cThat\u2019s when I met them,\u201d he says. \u201cWe hit it off and became friends. I asked them to play on what became Absolute Zero. We did a session with yMusic in New York. We worked on six pieces; five ended up on the record. It just went from there. Music\u2019s leader Rob Moose started doing some things on his own on some new songs that I would write. Rob arranging on his own \u2013 where he puts down twenty different string parts (\u2018Give me another one! OK, there\u2019s that. Another track! Another track!\u2019) \u2013 is quite something to see, working his magic in the studio.\u201d <BR>The genesis of Absolute Zero, however, began within Hornsby\u2019s work as a film composer for writer-director Spike Lee. Hornsby started collaborating with Lee in 1992; ultimately, in 2008, he began scoring for Lee. Since then Hornsby has written six full film scores and contributed incidental music to four others.

Suzanne was also the host of the public radio series \"American Mavericks,\" thirteen hour-long programs featuring the histories and the music of the iconoclastic, contemporary classical composers who revolutionized the possibilities of new music. The show won the Peabody Award for Excellence in Broadcasting.</P>\n<P>In 1996, Vega returned with the similarly audacious Nine Objects Of Desire, also produced by Mitchell Froom, who by then was her husband. \"Woman On The Tier (I'll See You Through)\" was released on the \"Dead Man Walking\" soundtrack. Over the years, she has also been heard on the soundtracks to \"Pretty In Pink\" (\"Left Of Center\" with Joe Jackson) and \"The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs,\" and contributed to such diverse projects as the Disney compilation Stay Awake, Grateful Dead tribute Deadicated, Leonard Cohen tribute Tower Of Song, and Pavarotti &amp; Friends. In 1999, \"The Passionate Eye: The Collected Writings Of Suzanne Vega,\" a volume of poems, lyrics, essays and journalistic pieces, was published by Spike/Avon Books. In 2001, she returned to her acoustic roots for her first new album in five years, the critics' favorite Songs In Red And Gray.</P>\n<P>In 2007, Suzanne released Beauty &amp; Crime on Blue Note Records, a deeply personal reflection of her native New York City in the wake of the loss of her brother Tim and the tragedy of 9/11. But the record is not a sad one, per se, as her love for the city shines through as both its subject and its setting. In it, Suzanne mixes the past and present, the public with the private, and familiar sounds with the utterly new, just like the city itself. \"Anniversary,\" which concludes Beauty &amp; Crime, is an understated evocation of that time in the fall of 2002, when New Yorkers first commemorated the Twin Towers tragedy and when Suzanne recalls her brother's passing. It's more inspiration than elegy, though: \"Make time for all your possibilities,\" Vega sings at the end in that beautiful, hushed voice. \"They live on every street.\" Produced by the Scotsman, Jimmy Hogarth and featuring songs such as \"New York is a Woman\" and \"Ludlow Street,\" Beauty &amp; Crime is that rare album by an artist in her third decade; an album that is as original and startling as her first. Beauty &amp; Crime won a Grammy for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical.</P>\n<P>In 2006, she became the first major recording artist to perform live in avatar form within the virtual world Second Life. She has dedicated much of her time and energy to charitable causes, notably Amnesty International, Casa Alianza, and the Save Darfur Coalition. Suzanne has a daughter, Ruby, by first husband Mitchell Froom. Ruby, like Suzanne before her, attends the High School for the Performing Arts. Suzanne is married to lawyer/poet Paul Mills, who proposed to her originally in 1983. Suzanne accepted his proposal on Christmas Day 2005, twenty-two years later.</P>\n<P>Suzanne Vega is an artist that continues to surprise. In 2011 in New York City she premiered \"Carson McCullers Talks About Love,\" an original play written and performed by Ms. Vega with songs she wrote with Tony Award-winner Duncan Sheik (\"Spring Awakening\"). A pioneer among singer-songwriters. Suzanne has also embarked on a project to re-imagine her own songbook in a stripped down and intimate manner, creating four new thematic albums that will be released over the course of 2010-2012 called the Close-Up series.</P>\n<P>Ms. Vega continues to tour constantly, having just played dates with artists as diverse as Moby and Bob Dylan. Suzanne is planning US and European dates this spring and summer.</P>\n<P><A HREF=\"http://www.suzannevega.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Website</A></P>"}, "id": "59796558115", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/out-of-space-2019-bruce-hornsby-the-noisemakers-w-suzanne-vega-tickets-59796558115?aff=ebapi", "vanity_url": "https://out-of-space-bruce-hornsby.eventbrite.com", "start": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2019-08-11T17:00:00", "utc": "2019-08-11T22:00:00Z"}, "end": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2019-08-11T22:00:00", "utc": "2019-08-12T03:00:00Z"}, "organization_id": "225372329830", "created": "2019-04-02T21:29:23Z", "changed": "2019-05-30T18:51:17Z", "published": "2019-04-08T14:56:24Z", "capacity": null, "capacity_is_custom": null, "status": "live", "currency": "USD", "listed": true, "shareable": true, "online_event": false, "tx_time_limit": 480, "hide_start_date": false, "hide_end_date": false, "locale": "en_US", "is_locked": false, "privacy_setting": "unlocked", "is_series": false, "is_series_parent": false, "inventory_type": "limited", "is_reserved_seating": false, "show_pick_a_seat": false, "show_seatmap_thumbnail": false, "show_colors_in_seatmap_thumbnail": false, "source": "create_2.0", "is_free": false, "version": "3.0.0", "summary": "OUT OF SPACE 2019:\u00a0BRUCE HORNSBY\n& THE NOISEMAKERS w/ SUZANNE VEGA\npresented by SPACE at Canal Shores Golf Course\nTickets\u00a0 go on-sale to the", "logo_id": "59737661", "organizer_id": "18077063828", "venue_id": "31296884", "category_id": "103", "subcategory_id": "3017", "format_id": "6", "resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/events/59796558115/", "is_externally_ticketed": false, "music_properties": {"resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/events/59796558115/music_properties/", "age_restriction": null, "presented_by": null, "door_time": null}, "ticket_availability": {"has_available_tickets": true, "minimum_ticket_price": {"currency": "USD", "value": 3500, "major_value": "35.00", "display": "35.00 USD"}, "maximum_ticket_price": {"currency": "USD", "value": 8500, "major_value": "85.00", "display": "85.00 USD"}, "is_sold_out": false, "start_sales_date": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2019-04-12T07:00:00", "utc": "2019-04-12T12:00:00Z"}, "waitlist_available": false}, "format": {"resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/formats/6/", "id": "6", "name": "Concert or Performance", "name_localized": "Concert or Performance", "short_name": "Performance", "short_name_localized": "Performance"}, "venue": {"address": {"address_1": "1030 Central Street", "address_2": null, "city": "Evanston", "region": "IL", "postal_code": "60201", "country": "US", "latitude": "42.06295", "longitude": "-87.68653410000002", "localized_address_display": "1030 Central Street, Evanston, IL 60201", "localized_area_display": "Evanston, IL", "localized_multi_line_address_display": ["1030 Central Street", "Evanston, IL 60201"]}, "resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/venues/31296884/", "id": "31296884", "age_restriction": null, "capacity": null, "name": "Canal Shores Golf Course", "latitude": "42.06295", "longitude": "-87.68653410000002"}, "basic_inventory_info": {"has_ticket_classes": true, "has_inventory_tiers": false, "has_ticket_rules": false, "has_add_ons": false, "has_donations": false}, "bookmark_info": {"bookmarked": false}, "logo": {"crop_mask": {"top_left": {"x": 0, "y": 0}, "width": 2160, "height": 1080}, "original": {"url": "https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F59737661%2F225372329830%2F1%2Foriginal.20190404-211108?auto=compress&s=1437657a768e0d32e3f80eedb3445ed0", "width": 2160, "height": 1080}, "id": "59737661", "url": "https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F59737661%2F225372329830%2F1%2Foriginal.20190404-211108?h=200&w=450&auto=compress&rect=0%2C0%2C2160%2C1080&s=3d1a97c919edb20736637feac85cf93b", "aspect_ratio": "2", "edge_color": "#000000", "edge_color_set": true}}, {"name": {"text": "Typhanie Monique\u00a0", "html": "Typhanie Monique\u00a0"}, "description": {"text": "DOORS: 6:00pm \u00a0| \u00a0SHOW: 7:00pm\nTo see a detailed seat map, please choose \"Tickets\" in the upper righthand corner, select your ticket choices & click \"view on map.\"\u00a0\n\nABOUT THE ARTIST\nGenre: Jazz\nJazzTimes magazine describes vocalist Typhanie Monique as a \u201cmodern-day Sarah Vaughan with iridescent traces of Lena Horne.\u201d Music lovers in her hometown of Chicago and throughout the Midwest know her as that region\u2019s local favorite\u2014warm, soulful and charismatic.\nTyphanie is a performer, educator and recording artist whose three critically acclaimed, independently produced albums have captured the ears of Chicago Tribune jazz critic Howard Reich and thousands of dedicated fans.

Blues Bureau International) to the indigenous youth and all young people on the indigenous reservations.\nMato Nanji\u2019s father, the late Greg Zephier, Sr., was a well-known and highly respected spiritual advisor and spokesperson for the International Indian Treaty Council. In addition to this leadership role, he was an accomplished musician and a member of the musical group, The Vanishing Americans. Formed by Greg and his brothers in the \u201860\u2019s, The Vanishing Americans toured nationally and shared bills with such legends as Bonnie Raitt. Besides being heavily influenced by the music his father and uncles were making, Mato was exposed to Greg\u2019s vast collection of blues records by legendary artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan and B.B. King. Consequently, Mato embraced and began utilizing his own musical talent at a young age. With the experience, love and wisdom of their father to guide them, Mato, his brother, sister and cousin formed the band Indigenous while in their late teens.\nAfter much time invested in practicing and building a following, they began touring extensively across the country. In 1998, they released their award winning debut album Things We Do. The title track\u2019s video, directed by Chris Eyre (Smoke Signals), won the American Indian Film Festival Award and was shown at the prestigious Sundance Film Festival. Indigenous\u2019 music caught the attention of blues icon B.B. King and the young band was invited to play on his annual B.B. King\u2019s Blues Tour in 1999. Sadly, Mr. Zephier would pass away before seeing his children receive this great honor. With momentum gaining, Indigenous\u2019 2000 sophomore release, Circle, was produced and arranged by Stevie Ray Vaughan\u2019s longtime friend and collaborator, the late Doyle Bramhall, Sr. Three more cds; Fistful of Dirt (2002), Indigenous (2003) and Long Way Home (2005) would follow before the 2006 decision by the siblings to \u2018disband\u2019 and pursue their own musical paths but Mato carried on with the Indigenous band name. \u201cPlaying with my family for 10 years was a lot of fun, but it was time to grow and keep moving forward.\u201d\nMato continued touring and in 2006 released Chasing The Sun. Two of the cd\u2019s songs, \u201cCome On Home\u201d and \u201cLeaving\u201d, were featured on the hit Discovery Channel show The Deadliest Catch. \u201cCome on Home\u201d was also featured on FX\u2019s Sons of Anarchy.\nOn 2008\u2019s Broken Lands, an intensely personal record, Mato and Leah, his lyricist and wife, pay tribute to his Native heritage. The album decries the poverty, isolation and reality of life on the reservation with \u201cPlace I Know.\u201d The album gains its title from the line, \u201call is lost in these broken lands.\u201d\nOf The Acoustic Sessions (released in 2010), Mato commented, \u201cIt\u2019s a collection of some of my favorite songs that celebrate 10 years of releasing albums. Every song that I have ever written began with the acoustic guitar, so it only felt natural to create an acoustic album.\u201d\nIndigenous featuring Mato Nanji (2012) would mark Nanji\u2019s debut on the Blues Bureau International label and the beginning of his collaboration with noted producer, Mike Varney. Joining Mato on the disc\u2019s opening track \u201cFree Yourself, Free Your Mind\u201d is the soulful Jonny Lang. On it, the two guitar-masters trade vocals and guitar solos. It\u2019s truly a blues lover\u2019s \u2018match made in heaven\u2019.\nIn addition to his Indigenous \u2018day job\u2019, Mato Nanji has been a member of the critically acclaimed Experience Hendrix Tour since 2002. Playing alongside original Jimi Hendrix band members Billy Cox and the late Mitch Mitchell, the tour roster includes some of today\u2019s blues greats including Buddy Guy, Chris Layton and Tommy Shannon (Double Trouble), Jonny Lang, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Eric Johnson, and Robert Randolph.\nOnce the 2012 Experience Hendrix Tour concluded, Mato and fellow EHT tour mates David Hidalgo (Los Lobos) and Luther Dickinson (North Mississippi Allstars) would collaborate and release the hard-driving, psychedelic blues-infused 3 Skulls and the Truth (Blues Bureau International) disc. The album\u2019s no-holds barred setting is the ideal foundation for the three veteran axemen to simply \u2018let it fly\u2019.\nFebruary 2013 would bring the Mato Nanji-inspired release from trance-blues artist Otis Taylor, My World Is Gone (Telarc). Mato and Otis explore the plight of the American Indian people in a lightning bolt of musical creativity and social commentary. \"Mato inspired the entire direction of this album,\" says Taylor. \"We were talking about history backstage at a Jimi Hendrix tribute concert he had just played, and, in reference to his people, the Native American Nakota Nation, he said 'My world is gone.' The simplicity and honesty of those four words was so heavy, I know what I had to write about.\"\n\"My dad was my favorite musician so he really influenced me a lot with everything. I just felt it was time to pay tribute to him and his band,\" says Nanji. That tribute, Vanishing Americans, was released on May 21, 2013 and promptly found its place on iTunes Top 10 Blues Chart. Blues Rock Review (6/5/13) said: \u201ceach song is brought together with heavy and powerful guitar riffs akin to those of Carlos Santana and Jimi Hendrix, while bellowing, raspy vocals turn a talented guitarist\u2019s vision into a relatable song for many, just as any praiseworthy blues album should.\u201d\n\u201cMato continues to refine his guitar and vocal vocabularies with each new release and is also expanding his songwriting skills with his wife Leah,\u201d said producer Mike Varney of Time Is Coming (May 2014). From the infectious opening track of \u201cGrey Skies\u201d; the Soundgarden/Rage Against the Machine influenced \u201cWon\u2019t Be Around No More\u201d; and the gut-wrenching blues of \u201cDon\u2019t Know What To Do\u201d, and at all points in between, Mato Nanji \u201ctears at his guitar strings, bending and shaking them to within an inch of their life, it is clear that he is no mere copyist. He is a genuine virtuoso\u2026\u201d (Rhys Williams, bluesblastmagazine.com 5/14).\nUltimately, Mato dedicates Time Is Coming, to the Indigenous youth and all young people on the Indigenous reservations. Of the song says Nanji; \u201cstill to this day, the struggle continues to just live in peace. Growing up here on the reservation I\u2019ve seen a lot of broken families\u2026broken homes. I feel our families\u2019 \u201cTiospaye\u201d are the core of what makes us who we are. Now family and its meaning is not as strong as it used to be for our people\u2026almost non-existent. So I send my heart and soul out to the indigenous children having a tough time in their lives and in their homes. This record is inspired by them and made in their honor. I hope for the best for all. Tomorrow is another day.\u201d\nThe Plateros, a three piece award winning family band from the Navajo Nation in Tohajiilee, New Mexico consider Mato Nanji and Indigenous one of their greatest musical influences.\nLevi and The Plateros played their first show, a festival in Bird Springs, AZ in December 2004, and by April 2005, they would find themselves onstage performing at the largest PowWow in the world, The Gathering of Nations. Lead guitarist Levi, with his natural born talent, slid across the stage with power chords and screaming blues that amazed the packed crowd. He was just 13 years old.\nIn the years to follow, Levi, along with his cousins Douglas Platero on drums and Bronson Begay on bass would receive numerous nominations for native music and video awards, and their cd Hang On would take home a win for Best Blues Album at the 2009 New Mexico Music Awards.\nIn 2012, they joined Indigenous for The Kinship Tour, with The Plateros opening the double bill. They would join Mato for blistering encores that would bring the proverbial house down.\nTouring in support of Time Is Coming in the summer of 2014, Mato Nanji would once again call on Levi, Douglas and Bronson to hit the road with him. This time, though, would be different. They would be onstage as Indigenous' rhythm section; Mato and Levi trading leads and solos while Bronson and Douglas provided the strong, stable rhythmic foundation that allowed the two guitarists to 'tear it up'.\nAs the band made its way across the east coast, the after show buzz was audible. The incendiary chemistry of Mato Nanji, Levi Platero, Bronson Begay and Douglas Platero innate.\nThey are Indigenous.\nWebsite\n\u00a0\nFAQs\nPlease click here for a detailed FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

While savouring his victory, Cesare receives a visit from Cornelia, who begs him to spare her husband Pompey\u2019s life. Cesare is about to grant her wish when Tolomeo, king of Egypt (and Cleopatra\u2019s brother), has Pompey's head delivered to Cesare. Everyone is shocked and appalled. Sesto, Cornelia\u2019s son, is obsessed with killing Tolomeo and avenging his father\u2019s death after the latter brutally separates him from his mother. Cleopatra decides to use her charms to win Cesare\u2019s support in her efforts to become queen and rule Egypt alone. At first she is defeated by her brother\u2019s army, but is rescued by Cesare and falls into his arms. After a series of plot twists, Sesto and Cornelia pledge their loyalty to Cesare and Cleopatra, who, in turn, sing of their love.\u00a0\nRun time: 3 hours with intermission", "html": "<P>Love, power, and war.</P>\n<P>Giulio Cesare</P>\n<P>An Opera by Handel</P>\n<P>Creative Team:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Stage Director: Margaret Jumonville\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Conductor: Michael Pecak</P>\n<P><STRONG>Synopsis:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</STRONG><SPAN>The action takes place in Egypt, the day after Giulio Cesare\u2019s victory over Pompey.

The trio are co-authors of the best-selling book, Liberal Redneck Manifesto: Draggin Dixie Outta The Dark and have found critical success performing to sold-out clubs and theaters in over 200 markets across the country.</P><P>Trae, Drew, and Corey have firmly established themselves as three of the most exciting new voices in comedy of their generation. Often compared to Carlin and Hicks, or a modern-twist on the Blue Collar Comedy Tour, the trio of comedians and writers challenge stereotypes and deeply-held beliefs about what is means to grow up humbly in the South. Their unique brand of relatable yet belief-challenging stand-up entertains audiences across the US, including some of the most unexpected cities. Focused on coming together and exploring evergreen social issues, Trae, Corey &amp; Drew are blazing a comedic path to stardom.</P><P>Trae, Corey and Drew have been featured guests on The View (ABC), Real Time with Bill Maher (HBO), Nightline (ABC), Last Word with Lawrence O\u2019Donnell (MSNBC), CNN Tonight with Don Lemon and various programs on MTV, MSNBC, CNN, BBC, Forbes, Rolling Stone, Fusion, NPR and SiriusXM. They also co-host their own topical weekly podcast recorded on the road, wellRED podcast, which has reached over 2.5 Million downloads internationally.</P><P>Trae Crowder is a regular video contributor in partnership with ATTN: for Facebook and formerly, The New York Daily News. The trio are currently in development with a major broadcast network for a scripted sitcom series and a whole bunch of other projects they can't talk about right now because they've gone all
