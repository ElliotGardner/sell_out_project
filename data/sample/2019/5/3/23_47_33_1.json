Much like his diverse and ample r\u00e9sum\u00e9 (which includes esteemed leading lights such as Dave Holland, Chris Potter, Ravi Coltrane, Jos\u00e9 James, Somi, and Patricia Barber, among others), this album sees Smith fusing his original modern jazz compositions with R&B, pop, and hip-hop.\nThis leader debut shows Smith at the helm of a core ensemble consisting of pianist and keyboardist Kris Bowers, guitarist Jeremy Most, alto and soprano saxophonist Jaleel Shaw, electric bassist Fima Ephron, and singer/lyricist Amma Whatt, with Michael Mayo on backing vocals. The lineup expands on several cuts with the inclusion of several illustrious guests: saxophonist Chris Potter, bassist Dave Holland, guitarists Lionel Loueke and Adam Rogers, and vocalist Gretchen Parlato.\nAs the title KINFOLK suggests, the music bristles with a magnetism that can be only achieved by assembling the right musicians, building upon and blending their individual voices and developing a bracing group rapport. Indeed, Smith refers to the aforementioned musicians as \"kindred spirits,\" while embracing some philosophies gleaned from Holland, his mentor. \"Dave once told me, 'I really believe that musicians find each other,'\" Smith recalls. \"He feels that all the collaborations he's done and all the sidemen that he's hired came into his life on purpose, even though he might not have been looking for something specific. He discovers people along the way.\n\"KINFOLK is about the musical family that I've put together,\" Smith continues. \"All core members of the band have very unique and specific points of view.\" He reinforces the idea of family by composing tunes that touch upon his childhood: such is the case with the jovial \"Morning and Allison,\" whose title partly invokes Allison Drive, the street on which Smith grew up. The song stars Whatt serenading idyllic recollections of a child enjoying a bright, fun-filled Sunday morning.\nSmith recorded his parents - Lettie and Theodore Smith - talking about their respective parents on the mesmerizing interludes \"Mom\" and \"Dad.\" On the former, Smith's mother tells how her father migrated from Virginia to Detroit and was drafted into U.S. Army, then later returned to Virginia where he bought the family a house. The latter provides a vehicle for Theodore to recall how his own father tirelessly worked at Navy shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia during the Jim Crow era without getting proper financial compensation or promotion until decades later.\n\"I think of these stories as snapshots that ultimately gave shape to the Black American experience into which I was born, which ultimately informs this music,\" Smith explains. He goes on to stress the significance of having his father on the disc: Theodore Smith passed away in March 2015. \"He never got a chance to hear the music or the band,\" Smith says.\nSmith celebrates the legacy of his paternal grandfather on the haunting ballad \"Home Free (Peter Joe).\" The song begins with a chamber-like string intro then moves into a gorgeous hymnal melody, highlighted by Shaw's uncoiling of a splendid, blues-soaked lyricism. \"Of my four grandparents, Peter Joe was the one I felt the closest to,\" Smith says. \"He was a real buddy of mine. He died when I was only nine but I still think about him a lot.\"\nSmith reemphasizes the theme of nostalgia with \"Retold\" and \"Pages.\" \"Retold\" finds Bowers tickling a melancholy yet romantic melodic motif on which guitar and saxophone run parallel lines across. \"When I started writing this song, it always sounded like someone telling a love story from start to finish,\" Smith says. The dreamy \"Pages\" becomes a superb showcase for Parlato to vocalize the song's theme: turning the pages of a photo album. \"I've loved Gretchen since the first time I heard her sing,\" Smith says. \"She becomes a part of the musical fabric. When she sings, it's never about the singer being at the front and the band being way in the back. It's all one sound.\"\nThe spirit of the Black Lives Matter movement permeates the somber ballad \"Disenchantment: The Weight,\" another tune that spotlights Whatt's thoughtful lyrics and delicate singing. Underneath the prowling melody, Smith's drums martial rhythms that convey a sense of marching forward. Written in the summer of 2013 soon after the verdict of the Trayvon Martin murder trial, Smith says that the song's cyclical harmonic pattern represents a longing sigh that many people felt and continue to feel after witnessing these ongoing travesties.\nFollowing that aforementioned song is \"Spinning Down,\" an intricate tune marked by multiple subdivided rhythms inside of larger rhythmic cycles. Featuring Holland playing acoustic bass alongside Ephron on electric, intertwining saxophone passages from Shaw; incredible solos from Bowers and Loueke, and surprisingly the only drum solo on the disc, the song touches upon the theme of trying to ease a restless mind. \"It works well right after 'Disenchantment' because that song is about everything that's wrong,\" Smith explains. \"'Spinning Down' is about the mind trying to work all that wrong out.\"\nBecause Smith didn't come strictly from the formal matriculation of music studies as so many of his jazz contemporaries did, he lovingly describes his approach to drumming as \"unrefined,\" which in turns helps him distinguish his voice. He did, however, earned his bachelor's degree in 1997 in media arts and design from James Madison University. While he was still in college, the legendary singer Betty Carter recruited him for her world-acclaimed Jazz Ahead program.\nSmith says that the visual arts discipline he studied in college definitely seeps into his compositions. \"I love great movies and images. I've always had a deep interest in composing for film,\" Smith says. \"For this project, there is something very cinematic about the way that I conceived this record. That's why it was so important for me to cast the right characters in terms of musicians. They bring to life the themes of family, nostalgia and identity that define this music.\" Ultimately, Smith likens the songs on KINFOLK to film vignettes sequenced together to tell a greater story about the unfolding journey of a working artist. This music represents snapshots from that voyage - these songs are the postcards from everywhere along the winding road.\nWebsite\u00a0\n\n\nFAQs\nPLEASE CLICK HERE FOR A DETAILED FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

The song stars Whatt serenading idyllic recollections of a child enjoying a bright, fun-filled Sunday morning.</P>\n<P>Smith recorded his parents - Lettie and Theodore Smith - talking about their respective parents on the mesmerizing interludes \"Mom\" and \"Dad.\" On the former, Smith's mother tells how her father migrated from Virginia to Detroit and was drafted into U.S. Army, then later returned to Virginia where he bought the family a house. The latter provides a vehicle for Theodore to recall how his own father tirelessly worked at Navy shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia during the Jim Crow era without getting proper financial compensation or promotion until decades later.</P>\n<P>\"I think of these stories as snapshots that ultimately gave shape to the Black American experience into which I was born, which ultimately informs this music,\" Smith explains. He goes on to stress the significance of having his father on the disc: Theodore Smith passed away in March 2015. \"He never got a chance to hear the music or the band,\" Smith says.</P>\n<P>Smith celebrates the legacy of his paternal grandfather on the haunting ballad \"Home Free (Peter Joe).\" The song begins with a chamber-like string intro then moves into a gorgeous hymnal melody, highlighted by Shaw's uncoiling of a splendid, blues-soaked lyricism. \"Of my four grandparents, Peter Joe was the one I felt the closest to,\" Smith says. \"He was a real buddy of mine. He died when I was only nine but I still think about him a lot.\"</P>\n<P>Smith reemphasizes the theme of nostalgia with \"Retold\" and \"Pages.\" \"Retold\" finds Bowers tickling a melancholy yet romantic melodic motif on which guitar and saxophone run parallel lines across. \"When I started writing this song, it always sounded like someone telling a love story from start to finish,\" Smith says. The dreamy \"Pages\" becomes a superb showcase for Parlato to vocalize the song's theme: turning the pages of a photo album. \"I've loved Gretchen since the first time I heard her sing,\" Smith says. \"She becomes a part of the musical fabric. When she sings, it's never about the singer being at the front and the band being way in the back. It's all one sound.\"</P>\n<P>The spirit of the Black Lives Matter movement permeates the somber ballad \"Disenchantment: The Weight,\" another tune that spotlights Whatt's thoughtful lyrics and delicate singing. Underneath the prowling melody, Smith's drums martial rhythms that convey a sense of marching forward. Written in the summer of 2013 soon after the verdict of the Trayvon Martin murder trial, Smith says that the song's cyclical harmonic pattern represents a longing sigh that many people felt and continue to feel after witnessing these ongoing travesties.</P>\n<P>Following that aforementioned song is \"Spinning Down,\" an intricate tune marked by multiple subdivided rhythms inside of larger rhythmic cycles. Featuring Holland playing acoustic bass alongside Ephron on electric, intertwining saxophone passages from Shaw; incredible solos from Bowers and Loueke, and surprisingly the only drum solo on the disc, the song touches upon the theme of trying to ease a restless mind. \"It works well right after 'Disenchantment' because that song is about everything that's wrong,\" Smith explains. \"'Spinning Down' is about the mind trying to work all that wrong out.\"</P>\n<P>Because Smith didn't come strictly from the formal matriculation of music studies as so many of his jazz contemporaries did, he lovingly describes his approach to drumming as \"unrefined,\" which in turns helps him distinguish his voice. He did, however, earned his bachelor's degree in 1997 in media arts and design from James Madison University. While he was still in college, the legendary singer Betty Carter recruited him for her world-acclaimed Jazz Ahead program.</P>\n<P>Smith says that the visual arts discipline he studied in college definitely seeps into his compositions. \"I love great movies and images. I've always had a deep interest in composing for film,\" Smith says. \"For this project, there is something very cinematic about the way that I conceived this record. That's why it was so important for me to cast the right characters in terms of musicians. They bring to life the themes of family, nostalgia and identity that define this music.\" Ultimately, Smith likens the songs on KINFOLK to film vignettes sequenced together to tell a greater story about the unfolding journey of a working artist. This music represents snapshots from that voyage - these songs are the postcards from everywhere along the winding road.</P>\n<P><A HREF=\"http://www.natesmithmusic.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Website</A>\u00a0</P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<H2><STRONG>FAQs</STRONG></H2>\n<P><EM><STRONG>PLEASE CLICK <A HREF=\"http://evanstonspace.com/faq\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">HERE</A> FOR A DETAILED FAQ.</STRONG></EM></P>\n<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0</STRONG>Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

Fill up our form to apply by clicking here. Apply by 20 April.\u00a0\n***\nABOUT THE ARTISTS\n\uff2e\uff25\uff2f is...a 7-piece band influenced by pop rock, math rock and city pop styles. Their members have come from parts of China, Taiwan, and Singapore,\u00a0enabling a diverse sound that fluidly weaves through Asian pop, jazz, and blues. They perform bilingually, taking cues from other Asian bands who have made their marks such as Sunset Rollercoaster, Toe and No Party for Cao Dong. Moreover, this testifies to their sense of biculturalism from being in the United States as people of Asian descent whilst finding a means to express themselves creatively and communally.\nOf Methodist is\u2026an electronic singer-producer based in Singapore and Chicago. The multi-disciplinary artist created this project as an exploration of his turbulent relationship with Christianity especially in light of his sexuality. Drawing inspiration from Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale in his name, Of Methodist\u2019s work is political, dystopian and emotive. His whisper-like vocals contrast with the smooth and bass driven music that seduces but disquiets with the tension in the political implications of his lyrics. As an artist with a distinct visual fingerprint and direction, his imagery often work in tandem with his music. With visuals, Of Methodist develops a mythos and aestheticism that frames his works to further enhance the experience of listening to his music.Sleepool is\u2026a couple of SAIC students who sought their escape from the classroom and share their love towards a quirky mix of hard rock, pop rock and post rock. Lead singer Jackie started the band along with drummer Pipi, bass player Kelly, guitarists Fanfan and Bacai, keyboard player Ailin and backing vocalist Teresa. The band shares a secret guilty pleasure referred to by the code name KFG.Ultimatum is\u2026a group of people with different backgrounds but the same heart for music. Since they came together in the summer of 2016, they have performed at University of Chicago, Northwestern University, Depaul University, IIT, Columbia College, UIC, and many other business occasions, and wrote or covered over 25 songs.

Their members have come from parts of China, Taiwan, and Singapore,\u00a0enabling a diverse sound that fluidly weaves through Asian pop, jazz, and blues. They perform bilingually, taking cues from other Asian bands who have made their marks such as Sunset Rollercoaster, Toe and No Party for Cao Dong. Moreover, this testifies to their sense of biculturalism from being in the United States as people of Asian descent whilst finding a means to express themselves creatively and communally.</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN><STRONG>Of Methodist</STRONG> is\u2026</SPAN><BR><SPAN>an electronic singer-producer based in Singapore and Chicago. The multi-disciplinary artist created this project as an exploration of his turbulent relationship with Christianity especially in light of his sexuality. Drawing inspiration from Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale in his name, Of Methodist\u2019s work is political, dystopian and emotive. His whisper-like vocals contrast with the smooth and bass driven music that seduces but disquiets with the tension in the political implications of his lyrics. As an artist with a distinct visual fingerprint and direction, his imagery often work in tandem with his music. With visuals, Of Methodist develops a mythos and aestheticism that frames his works to further enhance the experience of listening to his music.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN><STRONG>Sleepool</STRONG> is\u2026</SPAN><BR><SPAN>a couple of SAIC students who sought their escape from the classroom and share their love towards a quirky mix of hard rock, pop rock and post rock. Lead singer Jackie started the band along with drummer Pipi, bass player Kelly, guitarists Fanfan and Bacai, keyboard player Ailin and backing vocalist Teresa. The band shares a secret guilty pleasure referred to by the code name KFG.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN><STRONG>Ultimatum</STRONG> is\u2026</SPAN><BR><SPAN>a group of people with different backgrounds but the same heart for music. Since they came together in the summer of 2016, they have performed at University of Chicago, Northwestern University, Depaul University, IIT, Columbia College, UIC, and many other business occasions, and wrote or covered over 25 songs. They like to add traditional Chinese elements and instrumentation in some of their songs and experiment with different music genres. They are currently working on original content set to be performed in the near future. </SPAN></P>"}, "id": "60373699360", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/neo-ultimatum-sleepool-of-methodist-neo-5-4-tickets-60373699360?aff=ebapi", "start": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2019-05-04T20:00:00", "utc": "2019-05-05T01:00:00Z"}, "end": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2019-05-05T00:00:00", "utc": "2019-05-05T05:00:00Z"}, "organization_id": "235185267905", "created": "2019-04-14T18:52:22Z", "changed": "2019-05-04T04:32:41Z", "published": "2019-04-14T18:52:27Z", "capacity": null, "capacity_is_custom": null, "status": "live", "currency": "USD", "listed": true, "shareable": true, "online_event": false, "tx_time_limit": 480, "hide_start_date": false, "hide_end_date": false, "locale": "en_US", "is_locked": false, "privacy_setting": "unlocked", "is_series": false, "is_series_parent": false, "inventory_type": "limited", "is_reserved_seating": false, "show_pick_a_seat": false, "show_seatmap_thumbnail": false, "show_colors_in_seatmap_thumbnail": false, "source": "create_2.0", "is_free": false, "version": "3.0.0", "summary": "NEO 5-4 \u65b0\u4e94\u56db: \uff2e\uff25\uff2f w/ Ultimatum, Sleepool, Of Methodist\u00a0\npresented by NEO at Homan Gardens\nOnline tickets go on sale to the general public Sun", "logo_id": "60352986", "organizer_id": "20020982670", "venue_id": "31975799", "category_id": "103", "subcategory_id": null, "format_id": "6", "resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/events/60373699360/", "is_externally_ticketed": false, "music_properties": {"resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/events/60373699360/music_properties/", "age_restriction": null, "presented_by": null, "door_time": null}, "ticket_availability": {"has_available_tickets": true, "minimum_ticket_price": {"currency": "USD", "value": 800, "major_value": "8.00", "display": "8.00 USD"}, "maximum_ticket_price": {"currency": "USD", "value": 800, "major_value": "8.00", "display": "8.00 USD"}, "is_sold_out": false, "start_sales_date": {"timezone": "America/Chicago", "local": "2019-04-14T11:00:00", "utc": "2019-04-14T16:00:00Z"}, "waitlist_available": false}, "format": {"resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/formats/6/", "id": "6", "name": "Concert or Performance", "name_localized": "Concert or Performance", "short_name": "Performance", "short_name_localized": "Performance"}, "venue": {"address": {"address_1": "3403 W Grand Ave", "address_2": null, "city": "Chicago", "region": "IL", "postal_code": "60651", "country": "US", "latitude": "41.899747", "longitude": "-87.711973", "localized_address_display": "3403 W Grand Ave, Chicago, IL 60651", "localized_area_display": "Chicago, IL", "localized_multi_line_address_display": ["3403 W Grand Ave", "Chicago, IL 60651"]}, "resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/venues/31975799/", "id": "31975799", "age_restriction": null, "capacity": null, "name": "Homan Gardens", "latitude": "41.899747", "longitude": "-87.711973"}, "basic_inventory_info": {"has_ticket_classes": true, "has_inventory_tiers": false, "has_ticket_rules": false, "has_add_ons": false, "has_donations": false}, "bookmark_info": {"bookmarked": false}, "logo": {"crop_mask": {"top_left": {"x": 0, "y": 265}, "width": 998, "height": 499}, "original": {"url": "https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F60352986%2F235185267905%2F1%2Foriginal.20190414-180547?auto=compress&s=22e996dac43faf16e546ab5d6335032b", "width": 1000, "height": 1000}, "id": "60352986", "url": "https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F60352986%2F235185267905%2F1%2Foriginal.20190414-180547?h=200&w=450&auto=compress&rect=0%2C265%2C998%2C499&s=85659c335ad104fae703afee5ebac2ff", "aspect_ratio": "2", "edge_color": "#638efe", "edge_color_set": true}}, {"name": {"text": "Spanish Rock Invasion", "html": "Spanish Rock Invasion"}, "description": {"text": "Day 2 of the \"5 De Mayo Fiesta\" brings out one of the best Mana Cover bands to Hobart IN!

Much like his diverse and ample r\u00e9sum\u00e9 (which includes esteemed leading lights such as Dave Holland, Chris Potter, Ravi Coltrane, Jos\u00e9 James, Somi, and Patricia Barber, among others), this album sees Smith fusing his original modern jazz compositions with R&B, pop, and hip-hop.\nThis leader debut shows Smith at the helm of a core ensemble consisting of pianist and keyboardist Kris Bowers, guitarist Jeremy Most, alto and soprano saxophonist Jaleel Shaw, electric bassist Fima Ephron, and singer/lyricist Amma Whatt, with Michael Mayo on backing vocals. The lineup expands on several cuts with the inclusion of several illustrious guests: saxophonist Chris Potter, bassist Dave Holland, guitarists Lionel Loueke and Adam Rogers, and vocalist Gretchen Parlato.\nAs the title KINFOLK suggests, the music bristles with a magnetism that can be only achieved by assembling the right musicians, building upon and blending their individual voices and developing a bracing group rapport. Indeed, Smith refers to the aforementioned musicians as \"kindred spirits,\" while embracing some philosophies gleaned from Holland, his mentor. \"Dave once told me, 'I really believe that musicians find each other,'\" Smith recalls. \"He feels that all the collaborations he's done and all the sidemen that he's hired came into his life on purpose, even though he might not have been looking for something specific. He discovers people along the way.\n\"KINFOLK is about the musical family that I've put together,\" Smith continues. \"All core members of the band have very unique and specific points of view.\" He reinforces the idea of family by composing tunes that touch upon his childhood: such is the case with the jovial \"Morning and Allison,\" whose title partly invokes Allison Drive, the street on which Smith grew up. The song stars Whatt serenading idyllic recollections of a child enjoying a bright, fun-filled Sunday morning.\nSmith recorded his parents - Lettie and Theodore Smith - talking about their respective parents on the mesmerizing interludes \"Mom\" and \"Dad.\" On the former, Smith's mother tells how her father migrated from Virginia to Detroit and was drafted into U.S. Army, then later returned to Virginia where he bought the family a house. The latter provides a vehicle for Theodore to recall how his own father tirelessly worked at Navy shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia during the Jim Crow era without getting proper financial compensation or promotion until decades later.\n\"I think of these stories as snapshots that ultimately gave shape to the Black American experience into which I was born, which ultimately informs this music,\" Smith explains. He goes on to stress the significance of having his father on the disc: Theodore Smith passed away in March 2015. \"He never got a chance to hear the music or the band,\" Smith says.\nSmith celebrates the legacy of his paternal grandfather on the haunting ballad \"Home Free (Peter Joe).\" The song begins with a chamber-like string intro then moves into a gorgeous hymnal melody, highlighted by Shaw's uncoiling of a splendid, blues-soaked lyricism. \"Of my four grandparents, Peter Joe was the one I felt the closest to,\" Smith says. \"He was a real buddy of mine. He died when I was only nine but I still think about him a lot.\"\nSmith reemphasizes the theme of nostalgia with \"Retold\" and \"Pages.\" \"Retold\" finds Bowers tickling a melancholy yet romantic melodic motif on which guitar and saxophone run parallel lines across. \"When I started writing this song, it always sounded like someone telling a love story from start to finish,\" Smith says. The dreamy \"Pages\" becomes a superb showcase for Parlato to vocalize the song's theme: turning the pages of a photo album. \"I've loved Gretchen since the first time I heard her sing,\" Smith says. \"She becomes a part of the musical fabric. When she sings, it's never about the singer being at the front and the band being way in the back. It's all one sound.\"\nThe spirit of the Black Lives Matter movement permeates the somber ballad \"Disenchantment: The Weight,\" another tune that spotlights Whatt's thoughtful lyrics and delicate singing. Underneath the prowling melody, Smith's drums martial rhythms that convey a sense of marching forward. Written in the summer of 2013 soon after the verdict of the Trayvon Martin murder trial, Smith says that the song's cyclical harmonic pattern represents a longing sigh that many people felt and continue to feel after witnessing these ongoing travesties.\nFollowing that aforementioned song is \"Spinning Down,\" an intricate tune marked by multiple subdivided rhythms inside of larger rhythmic cycles. Featuring Holland playing acoustic bass alongside Ephron on electric, intertwining saxophone passages from Shaw; incredible solos from Bowers and Loueke, and surprisingly the only drum solo on the disc, the song touches upon the theme of trying to ease a restless mind. \"It works well right after 'Disenchantment' because that song is about everything that's wrong,\" Smith explains. \"'Spinning Down' is about the mind trying to work all that wrong out.\"\nBecause Smith didn't come strictly from the formal matriculation of music studies as so many of his jazz contemporaries did, he lovingly describes his approach to drumming as \"unrefined,\" which in turns helps him distinguish his voice. He did, however, earned his bachelor's degree in 1997 in media arts and design from James Madison University. While he was still in college, the legendary singer Betty Carter recruited him for her world-acclaimed Jazz Ahead program.\nSmith says that the visual arts discipline he studied in college definitely seeps into his compositions. \"I love great movies and images. I've always had a deep interest in composing for film,\" Smith says. \"For this project, there is something very cinematic about the way that I conceived this record. That's why it was so important for me to cast the right characters in terms of musicians. They bring to life the themes of family, nostalgia and identity that define this music.\" Ultimately, Smith likens the songs on KINFOLK to film vignettes sequenced together to tell a greater story about the unfolding journey of a working artist. This music represents snapshots from that voyage - these songs are the postcards from everywhere along the winding road.\nWebsite\u00a0\n\n\nFAQs\nPLEASE CLICK HERE FOR A DETAILED FAQ.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.

His early influences include Mississippi John Hurt, Reverend Gary Davis, Doc\u00a0Watson, and Pete Seeger.\nIn 1984 Eric won the National Fingerpicking Championship. His first recording, Strike\u00a0(1986), is an original suite for guitar, flute, and bass. Although best known as a\u00a0fingerstyle guitarist, he is also a talented songwriter. Making Models (Waterdog\u00a0Records) demonstrates his bent for incorporating eclectic instrumentation with guitar\u00a0and vocals. Other recordings include Black Key Blues, which is a collection of original tunes and\u00a0interpretations of jazz and traditional American music. Kind Heroes and New Tradition contain these\u00a0same trademarks in addition to original songs. His latest recording, REVision, is an homage tothe late Rev. Gary Davis featuring many lesser-known tunes of the fingerstyle master.\nEric has performed and taught workshops in festivals and concert halls around the\u00a0world including Stamford Folk & Blues Guitar Festival, England; Wirral International\u00a0Guitar Festival, Liverpool; Ullapool Guitar Festival, Scotland; Freight & Salvage,\u00a0Berkeley; Chet Atkins Appreciation Society, Nashville; and Steve Kaufman\u2019s Acoustic\u00a0Kamp, Maryville, Tennessee.

His lucid playing\u00a0encompasses the down-home rhythmic groove of a Mississippi John Hurt or Leadbelly,\u00a0and the sheer fluidity and melodic flair of such contemporaries as Leo Kottke. A soul-satisfying instrumentalist, Phil draws listeners in with his voice as well, singing in a\u00a0warm, plainspoken baritone that blends smoothly with his rock-solid guitar work.\nHeywood has been based in Minneapolis-St. Paul since the mid-eighties, performing\u00a0locally and regionally. In 1986 he won the National Fingerpicking Championship, and\u00a0followed up a year later by winning the American Fingerstyle Guitar Festival\u00a0Competition. Phil has played on NPR\u2019s A Prairie Home Companion with guitar legend\u00a0Chet Atkins, performed with fellow acoustic guitar luminaries Leo Kottke, Peter Lang, Pat Donohue,\nTim Sparks, and Dakota Dave Hull, and opened shows for such artists as Norman\u00a0Blake, Greg Brown, John Renbourn, Chris Smither, and John Hammond.\u00a0He has recorded six CDs: Some Summer Day (1990), Local Joe (1996), Circle Tour\u00a0(2000), Banks of the River (2003), You Got To Move (2008), and Rollin\u2019 On (2014).\nWebsite\u00a0| Youtube\u00a0\n\nFAQs\nPLEASE CLICK\u00a0HERE\u00a0FOR A MORE DETAILED FAQ.\u00a0\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages.
